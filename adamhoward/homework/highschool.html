<h1>Adam'z High School Experience</h1>
<IMG SRC="../images/tmlogo.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
I spent my four high school years at Thomas More High School, a private Catholic school of about 700 students in grades 9 through 12, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After four years, I was number two in the class, surpassed only by <a href="mailto:rruiz@leland.stanford.edu">Rudy Ruiz</a>, who finished with a GPA significantly higher than mine.<P>

In case you care (yeah, right) here's a copy of the handout that explains the grading system at Thomas More:
<FONT FACE="Courier New">
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>GRADING SYSTEM</DIV><P>
<Thomas More's grade system is letters grades from A+ through F with the following comparison of letters and values used to compute grade point average (GPA)<P>

HONORS COURSES<P>
Courses which are part of the honors program at Thomas More cover more difficult and in greater depth material. A higher quality of work is expected and there is a regular course against which to compare the course. Departments which include honors course must re-evaluate those course with the Assistant Principle for Academic Affairs yearly.<P>
Honors courses which include Geometry Honors, Algebra II/Trig Honors, Calculus, English II Honors, English III Honors, English IV Honors, Biology Honors, Chemistry Honors, and Physics Honors will be weighted for determining Grade Point Average, according to the following system.<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD>A+ = 5.0</TD><TD>B+ = 4.0</TD><TD>C+ = 3.0</TD><TD>D+ = 2.0</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>A = 4.7</TD><TD>B = 3.7</TD><TD>C = 2.7</TD><TD>D = 1.7</TD></TR>
