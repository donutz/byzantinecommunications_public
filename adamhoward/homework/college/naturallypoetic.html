	References to nature are often found in the poetry of 
both William Wordsworth and Emily Dickinson. Good examples 
of this are Wordsworth's poem "My Heart Leaps Up" and 
Dickinson's poem 273 ("`Nature` is what we see--"). Both of 
these poems examine nature. They take slightly different 
approaches to do this. Both of these poems explore 
perceptions of nature and examine the relationship between 
nature and the workings of the human mind.<P>
	Perception of nature is explored by both poems. The 
language of each poem makes this apparent. The key words in 
Wordsworth's poem, in the line "My heart leaps up when I 
behold," is 'behold.' The speaker does more than just see 
the rainbow; he beholds it. Likewise, the speaker in 
Dickinson's poem does more than just see nature. "Nature is 
what we see," and "Nature is what we hear." While Wordsworth 
beholds only one aspect of nature, a rainbow, Dickinson 
lists many aspects that can be seen and heard: "The Hill--
the Afternoon--/ Squirrel--Eclipse--the Bumble bee--" and 
"the Bobolink--the Sea--/Thunder--the Cricket." These are 
the perceptions of nature displayed in both poems.<P>
	Using thse perceptions of nature, the poets examine the 
relationship between nature and the workings of the human 
mind. Wordsworth examines in his poem how he percieves 
nature as he ages. His heart leaps up when he finds a 
rainbow in the sky. Likewise, nature has had this effect on 
him when he was a child, and as a man, and so will it when 
he grows old. Nature has always caused the sense of 
fascination in him, and this does not change. It is as if 
somehow he manages to keep his childhood fascination and 
curiosity, or as if the sight of the rainbow triggers a 
memory that gets him to think about how he saw things 
before. Dickinson examines more directly the relationship 
between nature and how the mind works. She states in her 
poem that "Nature is what we know--/ Yet have no art to 
say". Nature is something that we have in our minds, but 
which we cannot put into words; we know it, but the 
definition is elusive. Dickinson says that words are not 
adequate to describe nature. Human language and, ultimately, 
the human mind are faced with limitations. In this manner 
Wordsworth and Dickinson examine the relationship between 
nature and the workings of the human mind.<P>
	Both the poem of Wordsworth and the poem of Dickinson 
deal with perceptions of nature and examine the relationship 
between nature and the workings of the human mind. 
Wordsworth's poem deals more indirectly with the perceptions 
of nature, while Dickinson's poem is precisely about just 
that. Wordsworth writes about the constancy of his 
perception of nature, the way he see's nature, throughout 
his life. Dickinson writes that though nature is easily seen 
and heard all around, and even if it is something that we 
know, it is very difficult to give a true description of it. 
These are the perceptions and examinations of nature of 
Wordsworth and Dickinson in their poems.<P>
