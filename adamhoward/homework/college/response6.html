<P>This selection is well written and easy to read. It seems to me that Jungk at times glorifies the scientists, making them almost godlike. Indeed, to Jungk, Göttingen is almost a metaphor for Mount Olympus, Felix Klein as Zeus.</P>
<P>It was interesting to read that after World War I, Americans would often come to study the sciences in Europe because America was still teaching the old physics; this contrasts with the scenario today, where the United States is one of the technological leaders of the world.</P> 
<P>In the earlier part of the reading, Jungk seems to set up the story for a main character; however, as soon as he chooses one to follow, the story then builds up to another man, and then another, in Göttingen, this dwelling place of the gods of science.</P>
<P>By the third chapter it is clear that this idyllic place can no longer be as such. Like the modern world, science was becoming more closely involved with technology; the question was no longer "What can we do?" but "How can this help us?" Science became politically motivated.</P>
<P>I was somewhat (but not entirely) surprised to read that after the discovery of the neutron and the mentioning that it could be a source of great atomic power, that this had almost no impact on science at the time it was first learned. I was surprised because it was just more than a decade after the discovery of the neutron that the first atomic bombs were produced and demonstrated a vast power to the world. Yet I was not surprised because it seems that many great discoveries are not immediately known to be great.</P>
