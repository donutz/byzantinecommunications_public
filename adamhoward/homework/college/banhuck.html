	There is an ongoing controversy over whether Mark
Twain’s book <I>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</I> should be
banned. <P>
Some people argue that the book should be banned for it’s
obviously racist content. They say that Twain’s use of
dialect for Jim, writing out sounds rather than words,
portrays Jim as a stupid character. Jim’s superstitions and
his subservient role in many parts of the novel strengthen
their belief that the book should be banned. In the same
manner, the portrayal of the white society in the book is a
reason why it should be banned. The white people take
advantage of the black people in this book. The book should
also be banned for all of its violent content.<P>
	The book should not be banned because it is a violation
of our First Amendment rights. Banning this book would
impede upon these rights of ours. Also, even though there
may be violence in this book, it is no more than can be seen
by watching the daily news or the latest movie. The book
should not be banned because the Twain had a higher purpose
when he wrote it; it was not just a story, but it had a
moral to it; as Huck grows and changes throughout the story,
so should the reader see Twain’s attitude toward his
society.<P>
