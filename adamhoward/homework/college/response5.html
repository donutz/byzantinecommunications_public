<P>I found Sayre's writing to be at times sympathetic to Rosalind Franklin, at times belligerent against James Watson. Sayre refers to Franklin by her first name, making a more personal connection with her, but refers to Watson by his last name, building a distance between herself and him. And she does call Watson "naughty." </P>
<P>Sayre also keeps her reader unaware of just what it is that Franklin is doing; she says that Franklin is working on the A form or B form of DNA, but doesn't bother to explain what this means or how Franklin did her experimenting.</P>
<P>I understand that Sayre is trying to make the public aware of the fact that Franklin is not the Franklin portrayed by Watson in his <I>Double Helix</I>, but was as much a scientist as any other scientist. However, it comes across to me more as whining, especially the passage about the race to discover the structure of DNA: "It is a race which has been so much publicized after the event that it takes some courage to announce that it, in fact, never took place." It just sounds to me like this is something which the stereotypical 'sore loser' would say.</P>
<P>Klug in his <I>Franklin and DNA</I> is also sympathetic to Franklin, however, he goes into more detail about her studying of the two forms of DNA, and how, had Watson and Crick not found it first, she might have eventually come to see DNA as a double helix.</P>
<P>The other writers had a variety of reactions to <I>Double Helix</I>, ranging from critical of Watson to saddened by Watson to applauding Watson's revealing the true life of a scientist.</P>
