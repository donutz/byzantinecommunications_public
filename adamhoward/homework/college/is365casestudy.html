<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>After a thorough study of the business environment surrounding the UW
Financial Aid Office, we compiled the following document providing an
informative explanation of requirements surrounding additional web
functionality as well as a programming template for the actual
implementation of this functionality.  From a financial standpoint, we
considered only bare-minimum requirements for the system as well as
expected cash flow savings.  In addition to this conservative financial
analysis, we also included several additional propositions for the
office should there be room within future budgets.  These propositions
include a Dell PowerEdge 6450 with additional UPS and RAID

functionalities and the hiring of additional DoIT consultants.  The
current networking structure, a PVC of 100MB, should be sufficient to
cover requirements; however, an additional allocation of optional SVC
may be appropriate during the busiest time of the Financial Aid
annum.</p>

<p>This project was ultimately a valuable learning experience because it
created in us a sensitivity to the numerous considerations that one must
undertake before implementing a web solution.  The size, stability, and
flexibility of the network are especially important when considering a
secure, customer-oriented system like the one we chose to implement at
the Financial Aid Office.  This stability depends on a number of
disparate factors, which we explore in the following pages.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Scope of the Business Case</h3>
	
<p>In order to provide the Financial Aid office with the most relevant
and useful technological solutions, we met with both the lead functional and
technical Information Technology personnel for the office.  During our
communications, we found that they had already decided to implement a
number of the same ideas we had already had for improving their system.
For instance, one of their technical analysts is currently in the
process of developing an interactive web page that will allow students
to view their grants and aid online and decide which portions of the aid
they will either accept or decline.  The web page will be placed on the
Financial Aid website.</p>

<p>In addition to the current project discussed above, our group decided
to focus on making two additional forms interactive as well as providing
an online help system for students filling out one of all of the three
forms to be placed on the Financial Aid website.
The two online forms we will suggest are the "institutional" and "family
information forms.  The online help system will be analyzed according
to current E-Commerce and E-Business models and will aim to provide
students with timely, relevant assistance while balancing these customer
needs with the number of skilled hours that must be spent maintaining
the website.</p>

<p>By making all but the federal tax forms interactive, our business
model
will aim to effectively eliminate thousands of dollars in annual costs
due to mailings and human hours.  The online help system will be
especially effective in answering the common financial aid questions of
students before they are brought to skilled, busy financial aid
representatives.</p>

<h3>Background of the UW Financial Aid Office</h3>

<p>During the past ten years, the U.S. level of inflation has been
extraordinarily low.  However, due to a changing international economy
that demands highly-skilled, well-educated, and culturally sensitive
workers, the price of college tuition has steadily increased at a rate
twice that of inflation.  As the price of college tuition grows more
burdensome to students who do not have abundant resources available for
their college educations, financial aid offices are become increasingly
important to the effective distribution of grants, scholarships, and
loans to those who are in need of monetary assistance for the completion
of the respective programs.</p>

<p>Each year, the University of Wisconsin-Madison Financial Aid Office
assists over 18,000 graduate and undergraduate students to finance their
college expenditures.  The primary duties of the Financial Aid Office
include: the collection of necessary financial documents and aid
applications, the assessment of each individual student's need and
eligibility for aid, and the assurance of a timely and proper
disbursement of aid through the UW Bursar's Office.  In addition to
these primary duties, the aid office also works together with a number
of different financial institutions in order to ensure that students
have available venues to receive federally subsidized and/or
unsubsidized loans.</p>

<p>In order to determine each individual student's financial need, the
Financial Aid Office must request and store a large amount of student
data.  Up until 1998, they used a legacy system and mainframe database
as their primary computer system.  In 1998, UW-Madison was named one of
the secondary charter schools and for the PeopleSoft enterprise system.
Thus, they received the beta addition of the PeopleSoft application.
This system was implemented in December 1998 and is the heart of the
current Financial Aid information system.  Like other UW-Madison
offices, the Financial Aid office utilizes an Oracle database that is
administered by the DoIT office and allows for the sharing of student
data throughout the campus (i.e. bursar's office, colleges and schools
of the university, registrar's office, etc.).  The office currently has
one full-time IT employees as well as two additional DoIT consultants
working on their systems.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that the Financial Aid office is located at the heart
of campus, they already have access to very high-speed networking
infrastructure.  Their current available bandwidth is 100MB per second
-- a significant portion of this bandwidth is still available for future
uses.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="splitarrow.png" alt="[diverging arrows]" /></div>

<p>The following flow diagram was constructed in order to illustrate a
high-level understanding of the financial aid process:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="aid_flowchart.png" alt="[Financial Aid flowchart]" /></div>


<h3>Project Motivation</h3>

<p>What is most interesting about our work is that we are working to
help
e-enable this university's financial aid office. With the financial aid
process streamlined and online, students will better be able to track
their financial aid information, and update that information in just
minutes, compared to days or weeks by mail. This should appeal to
today's typical computer-savvy college students.</p>

<p>Since the infrastructure for enabling this process is largely in
place
already, with connectivity through the campus LAN, the majority of the
cost of this project is already taken care of, so that aside from the
purchase of a server computer, the financial aid office can focus on the
higher-level aspects of this project, rather than spend a lot of time on
budgetary concerns.</p>

<h2>Body</h2>

<p>Instead of organization this discussion around a specific business
plan
to help the UW Financial Aid Office implement their new system, we
explored a number of broad areas that relate to the technological and
financial feasibility of the web project.  In effect, the first six
sections of the body discuss these broad areas while the seventh section
is used to discuss the actual details of the ASP and HTML code which we
have proposed for the implementation of the new web forms.</p>

<h3>Justifying The Strategic Investment</h3>

<p>When applying a financial analysis to any business project, one must
first estimate a project's economic outflows and inflows before applying
the appropriate financial methodologies.  In the case of the Financial
Aid Office, the calculation of estimated outflows is very much dependent
upon whether or not a new employee must be temporarily hired in order to
assist in the support of the additional technological capabilities of
the organization.</p>

<p>The current functional lead of the UW Financial Aid Office does not
foresee the need for the hiring of a new full-time employee for the
purposes of the additional proposed functionalities.  However, she
admits that there will probably additional system complexities that may
warrant the need for temporary help.</p>


<p>Because it is unclear whether or not temporary help will be hired for
back-end technical assistance, we used two different financial
models -- the first assumes that additional help will not be needed and
the second assumes that additional help will be needed for two years.
In this way, when the Financial Aid Office has a clearer picture of the
necessary work hours, they can make a comparison between financial
models and make a more informed decision.</p>
	
<p>Both models will employ the same methodologies for the project.  The
first methodology that will be applied is the "Net Present Value" or
NPV.  Using the estimated inflows and outflows, NPV measures the current
value (in $ terms) of a project.  If the NPV exceeds $0, the project is
estimated to be profitable and, therefore, should theoretically be
undertaken.  The second methodology that should be used is the "Internal
Rate of Return" or IRR.  Unlike NPV, IRR is stated in percentage terms
and is used to state the rate of wealth creation that occurs during the
course of a given project.  If the IRR exceeds the current market rate
of interest, then a project is assumed to be profitable and should
theoretically be undertaken.</p>

<p>Assuming the aforementioned cash flows, one can see that the automation
of financial aid project is profitable according to both the NPV and IRR
methods.  However, it is important to note that these numbers are highly
dependent on the assumption that the Financial Aid Office will no longer
need to send out hard copy mailings.  In addition, one must also note
that the IRR is extraordinarily high due to the fact that there is a
very small initial investment in this particular case.</p>

<p>The results from the second case are radically different from the first
case.  Clearly, the decision to hire a new worker in order to implement
the new website will result in drastic financial results.  On the other
hand, the Financial Aid Office may decide that the intangible benefits
gained from a new system (i.e. higher college rankings, increased
quality of enrollees) may easily outweigh the costs associated with this
new project.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: It is important to note that there are additional factors to
take into account beyond the traditional methodologies of NPV and IRR.
In today's fast moving technological world, many businesses must
undertake additional web-based functionalities or risk being put out of
business due to market pressures (i.e. network speed and subsequent
customer satisfaction).  However, the non-profit nature of the Financial
Aid Office is different from a profit seeking enterprise and, therefore,
they are do not run the same risk of being "put out of business."  Even
so, non-profit entities like the Financial Office must still consider
obsolescence factors due to the fact that they are essentially competing
versus financial aid offices of other institutions of higher education
that compete against UW-Madison enrollment.</i></p>

<h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>

<p>Because the Financial Aid Department does not directly compete with
other financial aid departments, it is hard to measure the competitive
advantage of our proposed system.  Therefore our group will analyze how
the Financial Aid Department's performance influences the competitive
advantages of the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a whole.</p>

<p>Universities throughout the country strive to recruit the best students.
One of the tools used to raise students' interest in a school is the
school's national placement.  The higher a school's ranking, the more of
a competitive edge it has over other schools at attracting the best
students.</p>

<p><i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, a weekly national newsmagazine,
does the most famous ranking of colleges and universities in the United
States.  Its "Best Values" survey ranks schools based on getting the
most for your money. The following explanation of the ranking
methodology used by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> is from the
company's Web site at <a
href="http://www.usnews.com/" target="_top">http://www.usnews.com/</a>.</p>

<p>To determine which schools offer families the best value, we use a
formula that relates a school's academic quality, as indicated by its
overall <i>U.S. News</i> ranking, to the net cost to a student who receives the
average level of financial aid. The higher the quality of the school's
academic program and the lower the cost to the student, the better the
deal.</p>

<p>These rankings were based on three variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Ratio of quality to price. A school's quality ranking -- its
overall score in the "America's Best Colleges" survey -- was divided by
the cost to an average student at that particular school who received a
grant meeting his or her financial need. The higher the ratio of quality
ranks to the discounted cost, the better the value.</li>
<li>	Percentage of all undergraduates receiving grants meeting financial
need during the 1999-2000 academic year.</li>
<li>	Average discount. The percentage of a school's total costs
(tuition, room and board, fees, books, and other expenses) covered by
the average need-based grant to undergraduates. In the case of public
institutions, out-of-state tuition and the percentage of out-of-state
students receiving grants meeting need were used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall rank was determined first by standardizing the scores achieved
by every school in each of the three variables and weighting those
scores. The first variable -- the ratio of quality to price -- accounted
for 60 percent of the overall score; the percentage of all
undergraduates receiving grants accounted for 25 percent; and the
average discount accounted for 15 percent. The weighted scores for each
school were totaled. The school with the highest total weighted points
became No. 1 in its category. Next, the score was converted to a
percentile of 100.</p>

<p>The scores for the other schools were then converted into a percentage
of that achieved by the No. 1 school and the schools were ranked in
descending order.</p>

<p>As you can see, the amount of financial aid available to students is a
major factor in determining a university's rank.  The <a
href="http://www.wisc.edu" target="_top">University of
Wisconsin-Madison</a>'s overall quality ranking by <i>U.S. News &amp;
World Report</i> is a very reputable 35.  Furthermore, when compared
only against public universities, our Wisconsin is ranked eighth!  On
the other hand, when compared to other universities usually only the
financial aid related "Best Value" rankings, UW-Madison doesn't even
make the list.  Our proposed system will help the Financial Aid
Department streamline its operations, thereby indirectly increasing
UW-Madison's competitive edge in the rankings.  This could happen
through several means.  First, the number of employees needed by the
department will decrease, lowering the budget requirements.  The newly
freed capital could be directly applied to the financial aid reserves.
Second, improved efficiency would create more opportunities to lobby the
State of Wisconsin for more funding, and to solicit more donations from
corporations and wealthy alumni.</p>


<h3>Architectural Specifications</h3>

<p>	The architecture selected for this project depends on several factors,
including network traffic requirements, reliability requirements, and
any project cost restraints. Meeting both of these constraints requires
balancing expected results with what can be afforded.</p>

<p>	The architecture appropriate for this project is largely dependant upon
the amount of traffic that will be generated. The forms that we have
proposed to put online will do not themselves contain large amounts of
data. However, since 2-4 forms are sent to 38,000 aid applicants, and
those are then returned by approximately 18,000 students, we end up with
about 50,000 of these forms. Additionally, if email notice will be
generated and sent to every applicant at once, the possibility exists
for thousands of concurrent connections to the web server. Additionally,
the web server must make as many connections to the University's Oracle
database located at DoIT to verify and update the financial aid records
for each student.  For most of the time, however, this server may be
sitting idle, since most students take care of the financial aid forms
during the same period, in order to be sure to receive their financial
aid on time.</p>

<p>	This web server could be required to function over a large range of
traffic conditions, from small numbers of concurrent connections to
possibly thousands of simultaneous connections, both to students' web
browsers and to the backend database.</p>

<p>To accommodate the high traffic situations would require a high-end
server with fast components or several servers operating in a
load-balancing fashion. To ensure that the web server performs reliably,
it will certainly need to a well planned backup strategy, take advantage
of RAID hard disc mirroring, and run off of an uninterruptible power
supply (UPS). A more costly option would be to have multiple systems
running in parallel or load balanced fashion with separate network and
power circuit connections, with one system able to take over should one
fail.</p>

<p>	Cost constraints limit the available options. Depending on the budget
allotted for this project, the project may not be able to afford the
biggest, fastest system.</p>

<p>Various options exist that allow for different costs: choice of server
hardware (processor type, amount of RAM, amount of RAID hard disc
storage), choice of operating system (Unix vs. Microsoft Windows
NT/2000), and the choice of a single server or multiple load balanced
servers. To allow the system to function well while lowering the price
of the server, the financial aid dept may consider spreading out the
load over time: instead of sending out email notification to every
student at once, possibly resulting in many thousands of simultaneous
connections (Figure A), they can send them out over a period of time, a
week perhaps, to maintain a more reasonable number of concurrent
connections (Figure B), rather than a sudden peak. 

<img src="figures_ab.png" alt="[Figures A and B]" class="center" />

This could allow the
department to rely on only one server, rather than several load-balanced
servers that may sit idle much of the time. In addition the hardware
considerations, the department may wish to consider different operating
systems to determine which has the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO).
For example, FreeBSD and Apache web servers have proven themselves
powerful enough to run some of the busiest Internet sites, and both
that OS and the web server are available for free. However, unless the
department already has a qualified Unix system administrator, the
additional costs of hiring someone may outweigh the cost savings.</p>


<h3>Economic Aspects</h3>

<p>	In addition to the aforementioned financial benefits of implementing a
new web-based system, there are also a number of intangible economic
benefits that will be improved in the Financial Aid Office should this
business plan be implemented.  In particular, this section will address
the following non-monetary aspects that will result in intangible
economic benefits: reduced processing time, increased customer
convenience, and reduced errors.</p>

<h4>Reduced processing time</h4>

<p>By making the  "institutional" and "family information" forms online,
the Financial Aid Office can eliminate the step of manually entering the
information into the database.  Instead, the information will be readily
available in electronic form.  Having saved time, the Financial Aid
Office can give the information to the counselors, who in turn can make
decisions on offering aid packages at an earlier point of time.  Thus,
the response time to students will be greatly reduced.</p>

<h4>Increased Customer Convenience</h4>

<p>Putting the forms online enables students to download and submit the
forms 24 hours a day.  These online actions are much more convenient
than obtaining the paper forms from the Financial Aid office and
returning the forms to the office by mail or in person.
In addition, supplying the same information multiple times can be
avoided.  Examples of common information include: student name, social
security number, and special circumstances that must be taken into
account.</p>

<p>The online help feature gives even further convenience to students.  By
putting the frequently asked student questions and answers online,
students who come across problems when filling out the application forms
are likely to be able to find the answers to their problem.  If not,
they can submit their questions online and get back the answer via email
in a short period of time.</p>

<h4>Reduced errors</h4>

<p>One of the goals of our proposed upgrades is to reduce the potential
errors that are bound to occur during the manual entrance of student
information.  There will surely be a decrease in incorrect data entrance
after the new system takes the human error out of the error-checking
process.  This is especially important when specific fields are critical
to the decision of whether or not a student will be offered a relatively
favorable aid package.</p>

<h3>Outsourcing vs. In-House</h3>

<p>The decision to outsource information technology services versus using
in-house resources is an issue that many organizations face. Both paths
have their advantages and disadvantages, some of which will be discussed
here.</p>

<p>Outsourcing usually involves contracting with a firm to implement a
solution while maintaining project control and management inside the
organization. Outsourcing is an attractive solution to many
organizations because it allows in-house resources to focus on core
functions, save on personnel costs, increase flexibility, provide
increased access to new technologies, and allow access to highly skilled
personal who are experts at implementing change. Another positive is
that a consultant can bring in innovative views and may see your
business from a whole new angle, possibly avoiding destructive states of
mind such as groupthink.</p>

<p>However, outsourcing is not always the best solution and the negative
aspects must also be considered. Topics such as security and
confidentiality of data and other information, control and ownership of
the technology, lack of familiarity with the organizations processes,
and need of support once the contract is fulfilled. Also, there is
sometimes resistance to change from inside the organization. Employees
may see the consultants as a threat and oppose changes to their
(employees) tasks and processes.</p>

<p>The issue of costs could act as a positive or a negative, depending on
the situation. The biggest negative cost issue for outsourcing is that
a consultant can cost anywhere from two to ten times as much as a
regular employee. On the positive side, however, the consultant will
only be around short-term, while a full-time employee is usually a
long-term investment.</p>

<p>The Department of Financial Aid at the University of Wisconsin - Madison
currently uses a combination of department employees and contract
employees from the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) at
UW-Madison. One employee works full time for the department and there
are two full-time consultants from DoIT. The cost of outsourcing DoIT
consultants is about twice what it costs to hire somebody as a full-time
employee. At first it looks as if it would be smarter to cut the
contract with DoIT and hire two to four more full-time employees.
However, considerations have been made in the departments budget for
outsourcing from DoIT. Currently, enough funding is set up specifically
for paying for DoIT employees, so it would be imprudent to not use the
money for outsourcing.</p>

<p>Because the amount of funding for hiring DoIT consultants varies
year-to-year with each new budget, more money could be allocated in the
future to support the needs of this new system. The Department of
Financial Aid should petition for more outsourcing funds to support its
development needs. We recommend getting two more consultants from DoIT
to handle the implementation of the new Web-enabled financial aid
system, while the department employees manage the project and the
consultants.</p>

<h3>Selecting Technology, Equipment, Vendor, and Service Provider</h3>

<h4>Vendor and Service Provider: DoIT</h4>

<p>	Unlike most other business entities, the Financial Aid Office has
the luxury of not having to pay for Internet service.  This luxury is
due to the fact that they are automatically allocated server through the
DoIT system by virtue of being a part of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.  The greater service provider for DoIT is a company
known as Napnet.  However, for the purposes of our project, we did not
compare the DoIT and Napnet with other intermediate and large ISPs
because the Financial Aid Office has no compelling reason to compare
these services with other ones.  Instead of comparing service providers,
we instead researched the networking capabilities of DoIT.  In this
section, we first provide a diagram of the DoIT/UW network, and then we
discuss the use of ATM by DoIT.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="campusbackbone.png" alt="[Diagram of UW-Madison Network]" /></div>

<p>	The UW-Madison Division of Information Technology is the service provider for the entire UW Campus.  The UW network under DoIT may either be classified as a large Local Area Network (LAN) or a small Metro Area Network (MAN).  The following depicts this network:</p>



<h5>Overview of Technology Utilized by DoIT</h5>

<p>	In order to facilitate transmissions among its network, DoIT has chosen to use ATM technology.  Using ATM, DoIT is able to offer two main types of connections to their customers (DoIT, 1).</p>

<p>The first type of connection used by DoIT is an ATM LAN Emulation SVC
(Switched Virtual Circuit).  SVC technology is ideal for customers who
wish to configure and emulate LANs at different points around campus.  A
SVC especially helpful for the Financial Aid Office because it would
allow for the exchange of student information with the bursars office,
the back-end database located at DoIT, and other entities on the
university requiring access to student information.  A SVC also
represents a dramatic cost savings to the university because it prevents
the replication of general data that is used and updated by different
departments from around campus.  In effect, the unnecessary replication
of data was one of the main reasons that UW decided to implement a
general system known as ISIS using PeopleSoft Enterprise software.
The second type of connection used by DoIT is a point-to-point ATM PVC
(Permanent Virtual Circuit).  PVC technology allows for a dedicated
connection with a DoIT router and a virtually guaranteed method of data
transfer.  Using a dedicated PVC would be ideal for the Financial Aid
Office when current Internet connections involve the exchange of
important data with a student.  While it is true that technology may be
implemented to "rewind" a students transaction to the period before a
connection (and data) was lost, it would greatly assist the overall
administration of the system if such informational transactions were
guaranteed a virtual circuit.  On the other hand, from an overall
cost-benefit perspective, it is not truly necessary for a simple
informational transaction to be done over a PVC.  Multimedia is not
being used and the data is not time sensitive; thus, Financial Aid
transactions could presumably be denied access to a PVC depending on the
current system requirements of the UW campus. [Note: According to
Financial Aid representatives, their office currently has access to
100MB of bandwidth on a PVC.  However, we believe that this limit may
actually be artificially low due to the limitation of their Category 3
and/or 5 cabling.  If this cabling was replaced with a faster medium
such as fiberoptic, the 100MB limit would likely increase substantially.
 Of course, this occurrence would cause DoIT to re-evaluate the
appropriate limits of the office's PVC.]</p>

<h4>Technology and Equipment</h4>

<p>	In anticipation for the Financial Aid Office's need to purchase a new
server, we first considered the most appropriate server software for the
office's needs.  After that, we decided that best hardware available in
the server marketplace.</p>

<h5>Server Software</h5>

<p>While determining the appropriate software necessary for the Financial
Aid project, we took several elements into consideration.  The single
most important criterion set up under our analysis of this software was
the ability of the server to provide extensive support to a web
developer.  This priority is critical due to the fact that the main
objective of our project is to develop a website which allows for
client-server connectivity between a posted website and the back-end
database. The second tier of priorities considered during our search for
a package included the ease of administration and security.  The
Financial Aid Office can save a great deal of resources if the
administration of a given server does not require a great deal of
training.  This is especially important given the probable budget
constraints undergone by the office.  Security is, of course, incredibly
important due to the fact that Financial Aid information is of a highly
personal nature and a student would likely have grounds for a lawsuit is
his/her information was not properly secured over an Internet
transmission.</p>

<p>	A number of server software packages were considered
during our analysis.  Fortunately, this field narrowed considerably
following our decision for the Financial Aid Office to stick with their
Windows NT operating system.  With the operating system being known, we
were able to then narrow down the best server package available for
Windows NT.</p>

<p>	The following paragraphs discuss each of the three servers taken into
consideration by our team: the Microsoft Internet Information Server,
the Netscape Enterprise Server, and the Website Professional Server
(OReilly &amp; Assoc.).  After discussing each of these servers, a graphical
comparative analysis is done.  Finally, a recommendation for the
foremost server package is given.</p>

<p>	The Microsoft Internet Information Server or IIS is by far the most
popular server for Windows NT users.  Web developers are especially
empowered by IIS because of its extensive support for Active Server
Pages and ActiveX objects (Alwang, 1).  In addition, IIS began fully
supporting Java during and after its 3.0 release.  By allowing support
for Java, the IIS increases the ability of one to apply secure
connections through Java while still enjoying an ability to rapidly
develop richly functional applications in a less secure ASP environment.
 Other big advantages of ASP are that it makes database access extremely
easy on the back-end while returning all requests to the front-end as
standard HTML.  Ultimately, this allows a developer to create "dynamic
web sites and applications that are accessible by any browser (Alwang,
1)."</p>

<p> 	The second package considered by our team was the Netscape Enterprise
Server.  Recently voted the "Editor's Choice for cross-platform or UNIX"
by PC magazine, this server allows a tremendous amount of flexibility
and manageability for offices which rely on multiple operating systems
(Alwang, 2).  NES has performed tremendously well in tests versus other
industry leading server packages and also allows a great deal of
flexibility to an expert to reconfigure the server for his/her
departments unique performance and management needs.</p>

<p>	The third server package considered was the WebSite Professional by  '
OReilly Associates.  This package is specifically designed for web
developers running their systems on Window 95 or NT (Freed, 1).  The
WebSite Professional supports Java, Visual Basic, and ColdFusion (a
powerful client-server package similar to ASP).  In addition, it offers
several query examples that facilitate the development of an extensive
front-end for one's database.  The WebSite Professional is not capable
of conforming for a large corporate site, but rather is designed more
for an ISP or smaller intranet.</p>

<div class="center">Comparison by various criteria for server packages:<br />
<table class="border">
<tr><th>Web-Dev</th><th>Administration</th><th>Security</th><th>Documentation</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
<tr><td>IIS 3.0</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Excellent</td><td>V. Good</td><td>V. Good</td><td>$0</td></tr>
<tr><td>NES 2.0.1</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Good</td><td>V. Good</td><td>$1,295</td></tr>
<tr><td>WebSite Prof.</td><td>V. Good</td><td>Good</td><td>V. Good</td><td>Excellent</td><td>$499</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>	After a careful study of the three choices, we decided that the
IIS 3.0 was the best available server package for the needs of the
Financial Aid Office.  As one can see, all three possible choices
received very respectable grades with respect to the stated criteria for
a sever package.  However, IIS stood out due to the fact that the
Financial Aid Office operates in an exclusive Windows NT environment.
Therefore, there is no reason to implement the NES because cross
platform capabilities are not a pressing issue (although there would be
a possibility in the future).  In addition, the cost of $0 for the IIS
makes it an incredibly attractive option.  Last but not least, the
capabilities of IIS fit the needs of our projected ASP more succinctly
than NES and Website Professional.  Although both of these latter
servers do support scripting, they do not include ADO capabilities.
Website Professional, in particular, leans heavily on ColdFusion -- a
software package whose owners have recently experienced tremendous
financial problems.</p>

<h5>Server Hardware Configuration</h5>

<p>In order to run a high-traffic Web site, the Department of Financial
Aid will need either a high-performance server, or a cluster of servers
that will be load balanced. We recommend going with a single
high-performance server because the demand on the Web site will be high,
but it is not mission critical to have the site up 100% of the time. If
a student has an emergency and the Web site is down, they can still
contact the Financial Aid Department through normal means (i.e.
telephone). In fact, this would be the preferred method of communication
in an emergency.</p>

<p>We will present specifications for two different servers: one from
<a href="http://www.dell.com" target="_top">Dell Computer
Corporation</a> and one from <a href="http://www.compaq.com"
target="_top">Compaq</a>. For several reasons, neither of
these computers will come with an operating system. The first
benefit is that there is a substantial cost savings to the Financial Aid
department due to an academic licensing agreement with Microsoft, which
allows people and departments affiliated with UW-Madison to receive
software for little to no cost. The second benefit is that Financial Aid
will be able to configure the server to fit into their domain and choose
the role that it will serve (i.e. backup domain controller or member
server). We recommend that the server be configured as a member server
so that it does not have to worry about authenticating user logons or
replicating the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. This will
allow the server to focus its resources on serving Web pages.</p>

<h5>Server Recommendation</h5>

<p>We recommend that the Department of Financial Aid purchase the Dell
PowerEdge 6450. The main reason for this is, as you can see, there is a
cost savings of almost $4000 for virtually identical hardware
configurations.</p>

<h5>Power Protection</h5>

<p>Since this server will be serving a major function and also performing
database transactions, we recommend purchasing a Uninterruptible Power
Supply (UPS). An UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) provides a
conditioned and dependable source of power to your electronic equipment
when the main power source fails. These units protect against surges and
spikes (filtering) in the power source, as well as provide a continuing
source of battery power.</p>

<h5>UPS Recommendation</h5>

<p>We recommend that the Department of Financial Aid purchase an American
Power Conversion (APC) Smart-UPS 1400. Our reasons for choosing this
unit are that it is rack-mountable, so it can be placed directly above
or below the Dell server on the rack, and that it is designed to support
high-traffic, enterprise servers. The detailed specifications for this
unit are listed below.</p>

<div class="center">

</table>
</div>


<h5>RAID Configuration</h5>

<p>In addition to using regular backups, we recommend that the Department
of Financial Aid use an extra layer of data reliability. A Redundant
Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) is a very common way to ensure that
data is available in the event of hard disk failure.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="raid5.png" alt="[RAID Level 5 diagram]" /><br />
Source: <a href="http://www.raid5.com/04_01_05.html" target="_top">http://www.raid5.com/04_01_05.html</a></div>

<p>	The diagram above presents a good visual representation of the
RAID 5 disk-striping configuration. In this scenario a set of at least
three disks each allocate a 1/n ratio of space on each disk for parity
information, where n is the number of disks in the set. This ensures
that if any one of the disks fails, the information on that disk can be
recreated from the remaining drives.</p>

<p>	We are recommending RAID 5 over other RAID configurations for several
reasons. The first reason is that it provides better data integrity than
other configurations such as RAID 0, which is disk striping (no parity).
A second reason is that it is a very common RAID configuration, so there
would be a low learning curve for the staff at the Financial Aid
Department. The final reason is that it provides the fast read data
transaction rate. This is good because an Internet server is going to be
almost completely to reading data from the disk to serve out to the
World Wide Web.</p>



<h3>Planning for Implementation and Operational Considerations</h3>

<h4>Implementation Details</h4>

<p>Now that we have discussed the various factors that must be
considered
before new functionality is implemented, we are ready to present our
solution for the UW Financial Aid Office.  The following is a series of
screen shots, together with HTML and ASP code (Note: this code is only a
sample and not ready for a full launch):</p>

<div class="center">
<iframe id="screen1" src="is365screen1.html" width="90%" height="400px"></iframe><br />
<iframe id="screen2" src="is365screen2.html" width="90%" height="400px"></iframe><br />
<iframe id="screen3" src="is365screen3.html" width="90%" height="400px"></iframe><br />
</div>

<h3>Operational Planning</h3>

<p>The implementation of this system consists of several distinct
phases:
Installation (of hardware and software), Testing, and the final launch
into Operation. We will examine each of these phases individually in 
greater depth.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>	The server upon which this system will run first needs to be
installed
and configured. If additional hard disc storage or backup drives are
purchased through a different vendor than the server itself, these
devices must be installed into the system.  The system should be plugged
into an UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), which will ensure a clean
power source, free from surges or any other interruptions in power flow,
which could damage the server. The server should be connected with a
Cat-5 Ethernet cable to the buildings 100Base-T Ethernet network. Also,
the server should be physically secured, using security cables (such as
Kensington's Desktop MicroSaver Security System/Security Plates). If the
environment where the server will be located is open and available to
many people, additional security features might be considered, such as
floppy drive locks, case locks, etc.</p>

<p>	Once the hardware is installed, we need to install and configure the
necessary software. If the servers operating system (OS) comes
preloaded, it still needs to be configured properly, including setting
the administrator and user passwords, configuring the Ethernet device
for an IP address, setting up and formatting volumes, and setting
permissions on files and directories. The OS should be updated with all
the latest security fixes and bug patches.  Once the OS is configured,
any additional software needed for the system should be installed and
configured, including the web server (IIS if the server is Windows
NT/2000), database and transaction software (SQL Server and MTS), etc.
All appropriate hotfixes for these software packages should be installed
too.  At this point it would be wise to do a complete backup of the
server, so that if we need to restore the system, we will not have to go
through the installation procedures for the OS and each software
package. Once all the software packages are installed, we can install
now all the files we need and have developed for our system: install all
scripts, HTML pages, COM objects, ODBC data sources, etc.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>	There are two stages of testing that should be used, referred to
here as alpha and beta testing. Alpha testing is our own in-house
testing which will be performed, where we test the system with dummy
data, to make sure we have no bugs in our logic, no problems with
database connectivity, proper table/record locking, proper transaction
rollback. Alpha testing should also include stress testing, where we
determine the optimal maximum system load. Knowing the maximum load of
the system will allow us to determine the best number of students to
notify at once to come to the website and update their financial aid
information.</p>
	
<p>	Once the system has passed our alpha testing, we subject it to beta
testing, with  real-world data and real world users: we can select a
percentage of students to test the system, and report back any problems
they had with the system, including any undiscovered bugs,  any
difficulties with the interface, or lack of online documentation. Beta
testing often uncovers bugs or difficulties with the design that could
not have been found in a lab environment, but that could be detrimental
if discovered once the system is in production.</p>

<h4>Operation</h4>

<p>	When we are reasonably confident of the stability and
accountability of our system we can launch it in full to all students,
and begin our operations procedures. Once we have successfully
implemented our system, we are charged with taking care of the basic
maintenance procedures. Three key elements of our operational procedures
include auditing the system regularly, making fixes to the system when
necessary, and backing up the system as frequently as necessary.
Following through with each of these sets of procedures will help to
ensure that our system continues to work reliably into the future.</p>
	
<p>	Borrowing from the Just In Time (JIT) production philosophy, we need
a focus on preventative maintenance, to eliminate anomalies before they
become problems further down the road (McClurg, 1). Regular auditing of
the system to test whether it is running smoothly and working properly
helps us to achieve this. Our audit should include both the servers
operating system and necessary applications, as well as our web site and
database operations. The system logs should be examined for any
anomalies, and these should be investigated in greater depth. For
example, if a hard disc starts to show signs of bad sectors, we will do
best to replace that drive with a new one, rather than wait till it
fails completely. Likewise, we need to checkup our database system
regularly, and make sure it is operating correctly. To do this, we can
implement report generation in our system, to keep us updated on any
vital information.</p>

<p>	If we uncover any problems with our system, it is key that
we fix them as soon as possible. All necessary security and bug fixes
should be applied to the operating system when they become available.
Any fixes or changes to our database and web pages should be made to
prevent or eliminate any errors. Even if the system is operating
correctly, we may still need to make changes. Perhaps the server cannot
handle the number of concurrent connections, which might lead us to
alter our programs, or perhaps even necessitate the purchase of a new
server.</p>

<p>One element of our operational strategy that should never be
overlooked is developing a backup and recovery strategy.  As W. Curtis
Preston tells us:</p>

<blockquote>My father used to tell me, "There are two types of
motorcycle owners. Those who have fallen, and those who will fall."
The same rule applies to system administrators. There are those who have
lost a disk drive and those who will lose a disk drive (Preston,
3).</blockquote>

<p>Since we should expect to lose data sometime in the future, we need
to prepare for this loss, and the recovery from it. Preston defines a
six-step plan to developing a backup strategy: </p>
<ol>
<li>Define (un)acceptable loss</li>
<li>Back up everything</li>
<li>Organize everything</li>
<li>Protect against disasters</li>
<li>Document what you have</li>
<li>Test, test, test (Preston, 5)</li>
</ol>

<p>What may be an unacceptable loss another organization may here be
acceptable: if the system periodically send an email reminder to
students (stepping through the list of students in a defined order) to
update their financial aid information, and if we experience a system
failure at some point in the process of notifying the students, it may
not be a critical loss if a few hours of data were lost. Given the time
the system stopped working, we will know who has already been notified,
and after recovering what information is possible, the system can simply
reissue a reminder to any students whose information is not yet updated
and who had already been notified. It will therefore be up to the
department to determine the necessary backup cycle, and to follow
through with its operations. The backup schedule decided upon should
require periodic full system backups, with intermediate incremental
backups scheduled in between each full backup. An important point: the
best backup plan backs up everything except for certain items in an
exclude" list, rather than backing up only certain items in an "include"
list. If you forget to add something to an include list, this data will
never be recovered if you experience a loss (Preston, 8). Fully
documenting the backup strategy (indeed, our whole application) will
ensure that even with a change of administrators or support staff, that
all procedures will be known; and periodic tests of our backup and
recovery procedures will ensure a timely recovery when the system 
fails.</p>

<p>	The operations phase of this project means ensuring the system
runs reliably and effectively.  Key to effective operations are regular
system audits, fixes to the system when necessary, and a properly
executed backup and recovery strategy. Following through with each of
these sets of procedures will help to ensure that our system continues
to operate reliably into the future.</p>


<h2>Final Recommendations &amp; Conclusion</h2>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>In this case study, we have investigated the aspects to be considered
when making the investment decision for the information system in the
Financial Aid Office. We made our recommendations with respect to the
following aspects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Competitive advantage to be gained from having the system</li>
	<li>Cost to build the system in-house or outsource</li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding on the equipment for the system, we looked into the
following aspects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Security of student data transfer over the network</li>
	<li>Support to the web developer provided by the server</li>
	<li>Strategic control over web administration</li>
	<li>Cost of buying the new equipment</li>
	<li>Capacity of the web server to accommodate heavy traffic</li>
	<li>Reliability of the system</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to investment and the equipment, we gave suggestions on
the
implementation and operation planning according to the following
consideration:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Problem prevention to be achieved by a series of testing</li>
	<li>Possibility for the need of error fixing</li>
	<li>Data recovery in case of data loss</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of Immediate Recommendations</h3>

<p>These are recommendations that can be implemented without further
funding from the University or any other source.</p>

<p>The data handled by this system is very important. Therefore a
thorough
backup needs to be regularly performed. We recommend doing weekly full
backups and daily incremental backups. Tapes kept in the building should
be stored in fireproof cabinets. Additionally, several copies of full
backup tapes should be kept off site to ensure the utmost protection
against data loss or catastrophe.</p>

<p>Test. Keep testing. Then test some more. The importance of extensive
testing cannot be understated. The first thing to test is that no bad
data will ever make it into the database. Ensure this by checking for
such things as data length, data type, formatting, null values, and
other irregularities that will result in errors. The next step is to do
a test run with some people that will actually use the system to gather
usability feedback. Finally, try to replicate the amount of traffic that
the system will actually have to handle in production. Many sites in the
new economy have not been able to cope with the amount of traffic that a
production environment will require.</p>

<p>Put up a Frequently Asked Questions section to reduce calls to the
office. A good way to do this would be to break the questions down by
the parts of the form they relate to. Then put links to those questions
and answers by each associated section of the form. Putting the answers
right that the users fingertips will ensure that many of the most common
questions will get answered quickly and without tying up Financial Aid
staff.</p>

<p>Release information in shifts so that the server is not overloaded
all at once.</p>

<p>	Finally, once the system is in production, plan to open up its use
in
waves (i.e. work to ensure that the system is not required to handle all
of the data in a short amount of time, leaving it unused a great
majority of the time). This approach will make certain that the system
will be able to efficiently meet the required demand, pleasing users and
administrators alike.</p>

<h3>Summary of Immediate Recommendations</h3>

<p>If the Department of Financial Aid can successfully secure funding
for
this project, from either inside the University or an outside source, we
recommend taking the following steps.</p>

<p>Our first recommendation is to acquire one more employee from either
the
UW-Madisons Department of Information Technology (DoIT). We recommend
choosing this option over directly hiring more employees for the
department because the need for man-hours will drastically decrease once
the system is in place and the kinks are worked out. This will most
likely involve petitioning the Board of Regents for a larger budget, but
the Department of Financial Aid has many good reasons for implementing
this system, so it should go smoothly.</p>

<p>We also recommend buying a dedicated server for this system. This
application will most likely experience large amounts of traffic,
especially when financial aid application deadlines begin to approach,
so it is best to have something in place that will be able to handle the
demand. In our earlier analysis, we recommended purchasing a Dell
PowerEdge server, which is designed to handle enterprise sized
applications. It is recommended to purchase a good uninterruptible power
supply. This will ensure that the system is shut down smoothly in the
event of a power loss.</p>
