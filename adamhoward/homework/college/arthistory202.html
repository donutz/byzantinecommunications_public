	Any artwork can be compared and contrasted with any
other in terms of the many elements that make up an
artwork. All of the similarities and differences between
styles and form and subject matter can be related to or
differentiated from those elements found in other works.
This paper will analyze two artworks and illustrate their
differences and similarities.<P>
	One of the paintings which will be compared and
contrasted is by the French painter Hubert Robert,
<I>Capriccio of Classical Ruins with Pyramid</I>. Robert painted
this work in approximately 1760, using oil on canvas. This
painting can be found in the Elvehjem Art Museum, a gift of
Mr. & Mrs Firman H. Hass.<P>
	The other painting is Giorgione da Castelfranco’s
<I>Pastoral Symphony</I>. Giorgione painted this work around 1508
in oil on canvas. This painting currently resides in the
Louvre in Paris.<P>
	The work by Robert is enigmatic in its subject matter.
It shows a scene where people are gathered amidst large
classical ruins, with an out of place pyramid far into the
background. The people in the painting are largely unaware
to the mystery presented by the pyramid, they are either
relaxed or pointing or glancing towards one another.
Highlighting the mystery of the subject is the atmospheric
conditions. The sky above the classical ruins is for the
most part cloudless, blue skies. However, above and around
the pyramid, the skies are cloudy; the clouds enshroud the
answer to the mystery of the pyramid.<P>
	A viewer of this painting is led visually across the
canvas from left to right. The vertical thrust of the
columns leads the viewer’s eyes upwards, to the entablature
atop the collonade. Through the use of one point
perspective, the entablature leads the eyes back into the
painting, and to an archway. The arch forms a sort of door,
inviting the viewer through. The perspective is continued
on the arch’s keystone, and brings the viewer to the
pyramid in the background, the visual destination in this
painting. The archway also serves as a bridge, linking the
image of the classical architecture on the left of the
painting with the non-classical pyramid which is located
toward the right side.<P>
	<I>Capriccio of Classical Ruins with Pyramid</I> is done in a
painterly fashion, using areas of color rather than lines
and contours to define regions. The use of warm and cool
colors alternates somewhat as the eye moves from place to
place, especially from figure to figure. This painting
takes advantage of the use of planes to show the illusion
of depth. The light source is positioned somewhere to the
left of the painting, so that everything appears to be
slightly backlit. The columns help to filter the light and
contribute to the alternation of warms and cools in the
painting. There is the foreground plane which contains the
people as well as the front of the collonade, the middle
ground, which is defined by the front of the archway, and
the background plane, which is formed by the side of the
pyramid.<P>
	The subject matter of <I>Pastoral Symphony</I> is, like that
of <I>Capriccio of Classical Ruins with Pyramid</I>, something of
an enigma. With rolling hills in the distance, there are
four figures in the foreground, two male and two female.
Both of the males are fully clad; however, both of the
females are almost totally nude. Giorgione left no direct
explanation for this appearance of these figures. <P>
	There is no use of one point perspective, however the
small, hazy views of the hillsides and the horizon creates
the illusion of depth. Like the <I>Capriccio</I>, however,
<I>Pastoral Symphony</I> is done in a more painterly style with
less emphasis on line and more on regions of color. The
foreground of <I>Symphony</I> is dominated by warm colors, lit by
a light source which would be positioned somewhere above
the viewer.<P>
	The paintings <I>Capriccio of Classical Ruins with
Pyramid</I> and <I>Pastoral Symphony</I> bear many similiar and
dissimilar traints. Both are enigmatic and mysterious in
subject matter. Both are done in a painterly style.  The
light sources in both contribute to the effects of the warm
and cool colors. Both create an illusion of depth, but
through different means. The styles that each artist used
to create his respective painting are thus compared and
contrasted.<P>
