	Frederick Douglass took his first step toward freedom 
when he began to learn to read. Learning to read, first "the 
A, B, C," then words, opens Douglass' mind up to new 
possibilities. Knowing how to read is the way in which 
Douglass can escape the repression of Mr. Auld and all the 
slaveholders. The mental liberation that learning to read 
offers Douglass enables him to begin on the road to true 
freedom, and Douglass emphasizes the great significance of 
this passage through several means in this passage.<P>

	Douglass uses several methods to stress the importance 
of this passage in his narrative. One is his word choices. 
Referring to Mr. Auld's objection to Douglass' learning to 
read, Douglass uses words like forbade, unlawful, evil, 
bitter. These strong words emphasize the great objections 
that Mr. Auld has to Mrs. Auld teaching a slave to read.
Another method that Douglass uses is his list of contrasts. 
"What he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most
loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil
... was to me a great good, to be diligently sought ..." One
more method Douglass uses is the direct statement of the 
importance of this event in his life, and consequently, the 
importance of this part of his narrative. Douglass tells the 
reader that "the very decided manner with which he spoke ... 
served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the 
truths he was uttering." Douglass also says, "From that 
moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom." 
With these methods, Douglass emphasizes the importance of 
this passage of his narrative.<P>

	Douglass employed several methods to stress this 
passage of his narrative. His word choices, his use of 
contrasts, and his direct statement all reinforce the 
importance of the passage. Together with the rest of the 
narrative, this passage helps to form Douglass' impressive 
story with the purpose of putting an end to slavery.<P>
