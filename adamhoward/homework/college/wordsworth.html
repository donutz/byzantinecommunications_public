William Wordsworth gave his "Ode: Intimations of 
Immortality From Recollections of Early Childhood" a 
melancholy mood. In this poem, Wordsworth compares nature as 
he saw it as a child to nature as he sees it today. Though 
he says that nature has remained as it was, he cannot see it 
the same way. Wordsworth argues in this poem that as one 
grows older and his perceptions of things change, he loses 
the ability to see things as he once did, but he still has 
his memories to draw upon.<P>
	The nature that Wordsworth knew as is the same nature 
which he knows now. The rainbow and the rose and the moon 
are all still there. Yet "The things which I have seen I now 
can see no more." Wordsworth can't see things quite the same 
as he once did; as a child, everything was a source of 
wonder, "Apparelled in celestial light." But now something 
seems missing to him. Wordsworth longs to be able to see 
things as he once did. But he acknowledges that he will 
never again be able to see things in the same way as a 
child. <P>
	However, by the end of the poem, Wordsworth comes to 
terms with this. He accepts that he can no longer see things 
as a child does. But he realizes that all hope is not lost. 
He still has his memories, and he has also gained wisdom in 
his years. He does not see things the same, but he 
appreciates them no less. Wordsworth has lost the ability to 
perceive things as a child, but he now has a different lens 
to view things through, the lense of wisdom and experience.<P>
