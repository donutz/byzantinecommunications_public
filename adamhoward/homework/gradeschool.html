<h1>Adam'z Grade School Experience</h1>
My first experience with school was kindergarten. From kindergarten through the second grade, I attended Lincoln Elementary, in <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~cudahywi/">Cudahy, WI</a>. I then continued my elementary schooling at St. Paul grade school, a private Catholic school, in Milwaukee, WI. I stayed at St. Paul from the third grade through eighth grade. <P>
