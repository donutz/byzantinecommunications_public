	According to Catholic social teaching, and Christian values, of all the
forms of birth control, there is only one which is considered right and moral. All
of the rest are artificial, and according to Catholic beliefs, are not morally
acceptable. The only acceptable one is completely natural. It is called Natural
Family Planning, or NFP for short.  This method, completely natural, is the only
one endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church.  According to Catholic doctrine,
the artificial means of birth are immoral, and these means must and ought to
be replaced by the moral type, Natural Family Planning.<P>
	"Natural family planning (NFP) refers to the practice of achieving or
avoiding pregnancies according to an informed awareness of a woman's
fertility" (rain.html). It is based on the woman's rhythmic cycles of fertility and
infertility. When used properly, it has an effectiveness rating of over ninety-nine
percent, both at preventing and creating pregnancy.  "The Sympto-Thermal
Method is a system of using the mucus and temperature signs in a
crosschecking way for the highest confidence and reliability in family planning"
(rain.html) Using a woman's cervical mucus and morning temperature as
guides, it can easily be determined when a woman is fertile and when she is
not. Artificial means do not offer this.<P>
	One important advantage of Natural Family Planning is that it is all
natural. A woman using NFP puts no artificial substances into her body,
substances whose effects are either unknown or known but dangerous. 
Another advantage is knowing when a woman is pregnant. A condom, or other
form of barrier protection, might have a high reliability percent, and may not
necessarily have any harmful side effects (although latex allergies can be a
problem), but a condom can fail. Whereas NFP, when properly used, is nearly
one hundred percent effective. Natural Family Planning works.<P>
	There have been many attempts to show, however, that NFP does not
work. For instance, "the FDA Consumer for May, 1985 ran an article that listed
"Natural Family Planning or Rhythm" as having an estimated effectiveness of
very variable, perhaps 53-86%. Correspondence with the editors and U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services medical advisors to the FDA
Consumer revealed that the basis for that very low figure were two Latin
American studies," specifically, Columbia (effect3.html). In fact, the figures cited
by the FDA were misleading, because for the "Pill" they reported a 99%
effectiveness rating, when in Columbia the Pill actually showed an 89.5%
effectiveness they "reported only a 99% figure, supposedly from other sources"
(effect3.html)  In Columbia, failures of NFP are associated with failure of the
users to properly follow it; nevertheless, "it is well known among birth control
professionals that if you want to quote very low effectiveness rates for any form
of NFP, you go to Colombia" (effect3.html). But is it right to use Colombian
figures to explain NFP in North America, where the higher end of the
Colombian effectiveness percentage, 86%, is actually the lower effectiveness
rating in the U.S? In these ways, supporters of artificial means of birth control
attack the validity of NFP. However, the facts clearly show that NFP is the better
choice for birth control, for many reasons.<P>
	What is the Church's stance on the issue? Simply, the Church's position
is that all artificial means of birth control are immoral, and that the only moral
means is the Sympto-Thermal Method of Natural Family Planning. Why is this
the case? Is it merely because the church is behind the times? Is it because
the Church does not know about life in the "real world"? The answer is no. The
explanation for the Church's stance is  really quite simple. Sexual intercourse is
a means of procreation. Anytime intercourse is had, it must remain open to this
possibility, that pregnancy might occur. Natural Family Planning does remain
open to this possibility. The artificial means of barrier birth control do not, as
they attempt to block the possibility of pregnancy. And other means of birth
control, are no better. Some work to alter a woman's fertility, and the worst kind
are the abortive types, which cause an intentional miscarriage, an abortion.
Natural Family Planning does none of these. Although it is almost perfectly
effective, there is still the possibility for pregnancy,  a possibility not blocked and
not aborted. Natural Family Planning is just that: natural.<P>
	What reasons are there to adopt Natural Family Planning? One, it can be
an effective population control when taught properly. This can be of infinite
importance in 3rd world countries. First world nations can help these less
fortunates by teaching them NFP, so that they can control population growth
and in time become more independent and able to survive, both at the family
and national level. This is much more cost effective than constant shipments of
artificial means of birth control. Here in the U.S., NFP should be adopted too. It
is cost effective on all levels, from the government to married couples and
families.  Rather than spending money on artificial means of birth control, a
couple can put out a sum of money to be taught NFP (if, in fact, it costs them
anything at all) and then for the rest of their lives, they will have the most
effective birth control means available. In fact, not only do couples have the
ability to prevent pregnancies, but couples with difficulties conceiving can often
bear children by becoming aware of the woman's cycle through NFP. In
addition, NFP should be taught because it is right, it is moral. There is nothing
mystical about it, it is not a tool of the Church to control the masses, it is the
only effective and natural means of controlling pregnancy.<P>
	Natural Family Planning is the only moral form of birth control there is,
and the only form which should be used in Christian marriages. All artificial

means of birth control are immoral, and should be avoided. Natural Family
Planning allows for the possibility of pregnancy while offering an effective rating
of nearly 100 percent. NFP offers a long lasting, cost effective population control
on the national and family levels. According to Christian  values and Catholic
teachings, Natural Family Planning should be adopted as the standard means
of birth control.<P>
