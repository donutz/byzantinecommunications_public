	For my experience of a "justice outreach program," I went to the
St. Vincent De Paul Meal Program. There I served 8 hours worth of
volunteer work. While working there, I learned several things, including
what it's like to be a hungry person, as well as what it's like to help those
in need.  I leaned about what it is that the St. Vincent De Paul Meal
Program does, and something about how it accomplishes it. In this
paper, I will relate all that I learned, as well as give my own personal
reflection on the experiences.<P>

	The St. Vincent De Paul Meal Program, located at the junction of
10th Street and Madison, is designed to feed the hungry in the area.
There are all kinds of people who come in for food: young and old, new
faces as well as those who have come many times before, those who
truly need the food, and those who come only for the free food. However,
all are given a good meal and a chance to get inside, especially important
in the bitter winter cold. The meal program feeds many people, often
averaging at three hundred fifty people or more. And because they feed
so many people, much preparation must go into making all of the food
and serving it to the people who come. <P>

	Much of the food that St. Vincent De Paul Meal Program gives out
is either donated or must be bought. Some of the food is brought in by
people from the neighborhood parishes, some by schools having students
do volunteer service. Not all of the volunteer work is done by parishioners
or students, though. Aside from having a full time staff, the meal program
employs people who are on welfare, and only by doing this work will
these people receive their welfare checks.<P>

	The meal program addresses many injustices in the city of
Milwaukee. The meal program provides for a relief for people who have not
had their fair share of things, who have either directly or indirectly been
cheated by society. The issue of distributive justice plays a key role in
this situation. The people served by the meal program are victims of an
inequitable distribution of goods and materials and ideas and ideals
throughout society. These people have been left out, and therefore they
cannot find a way to express themselves in society, and so their  
contributive justice is weakened also. These people are given food and
drink at the meal program, so that they can try to get back on their feet
to become decent productive members of society, and they can return to a
more equitable contributive justice. <P>

	Commutative justice plays an important part in the meal program,
because it is all about people interacting with other people.
Underprivileged people and those who have their share come together,
and see each other face to face. This helps the person who is doing well
to realize the conditions that many people face in this world today. There
are people serving the hungry, who interact with them. The kindness of a
person thanking you for pouring them a glass of milk or a cup of coffee
shows you that like you, they are real people, not just images in a
newspaper article or statistics in a record book. These are people, and
have the same hopes and dreams as everyone else, but who have an
even greater difficulty achieving those hopes and dreams because of their
situations. However, they struggle on, enduring the hardships that so
many people never face and never know of. That is, unless they do
volunteer service work like this.<P>

	This program relates to the one important message that Jesus
proclaimed in the Gospel: to love your neighbor as you love yourself. The
people who work at the meal program follow this very closely, for if they
were in the same situation, they would want to be helped. This also
relates to the parable which Jesus told of the last judgment, when Jesus
told the goats that when they did not feed or clothe or help in any way
any of the least of his servants, they did not do anything for Him, and the
sheep did unknowingly do these things for Jesus by helping out the poor
and unfortunate. The meal program also relates to many of the messages
of the Church regarding helping out the poor, both messages from the
Church's past as well as messages of the present, like those of the US
Catholic Bishops.<P>

	As to effectiveness, this program has mixed results. In the short
term, it is quite effective and accomplishes its goal: to feed the hungry.
However, it is not as effective in the long term, because it does not
address the long term needs of a person, such as a home and a career.
However, it is not completely ineffective, since it does give the people the
opportunity to spend more of their time looking for jobs if they lack them
and less time worrying about what or if they will eat their next meal. <P>

	I have many thoughts from the eight hours I spent. I had been to
the St. Vincent De Paul Meal Program before, and so I knew the routine
of how things work there. When I got there each day, I helped prepare the
dining hall and helped in the kitchen. When the people started arriving, I
was one of the people to bring milk and coffee to people. I looked around
as more people came into the hall, and sure enough, I noticed that there
were several familiar faces: I had seen these people before, in the
springtime, when I was doing service work for my Confirmation. There
were many new faces too, and probably many who had been there in the
spring but whom I didn't notice in particular. Of all the people there, I can
say that there is no one defining characteristic which can be used to
describe all of them; all of them are different and individual. They are not
all the stereotypical streetperson, in fact, many of them were just normal
people. But for one reason or another, these people were all hungry. And
so they came here to eat. I saw that they had in much as common with
me as they had with each other. I learned that justice is not something
served in a criminal court, but something shared between people.<P>

	In the end, I learned something about myself and about society.
People are all the same, but all individual, and no person is any less of a
person than another, no matter what his situation might be. I learned that
for society to work, justice must be found everywhere and given to
everyone. This justice experience of going to the St. Vincent De Paul
Meal Program helped to shape my view of people and of justice, and it
has helped to change my way of thinking, knowing that whatever I do,
someone else will be affected, either for the better or for the worse.<P>
