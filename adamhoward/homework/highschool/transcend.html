     By the mid nineteenth century, there had arisen two
prominent groups of writers with very different philosophies,
the Transcendentalists and the Symbolists.  The
Transcendentalists, among the ranks of which were Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, could be considered optimistic
in their writing.  The two most basic tenets of
Transcendentalism (there were five all together) were that the
individual is innately good and that nature was the purest
place one could go.  The Symbolists, which included such
writers as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, on the
other hand, were pessimistic, and tended to reject all of the
ideas of the Transcendentalists.  They believed that man tends

toward evil and saw nature as an arbitrary force, neither good

nor bad.  While the beliefs of the Transcendentalists and

Symbolists could be placed at opposite ends of the spectrum,

neither group was completely right nor completely wrong, and

the truth falls somewhere in the middle.<P>

     As stated above, the Transcendentalists had five basic

beliefs.  The are as follows:  man is innately good, man is at

his best when he refuses to conform to tradition, society was a

source of evil, the purest place to which a person could go was

nature, and that there existed the need for social reform.  Not

all of these ideas are inherently optimistic on their own, but

as a whole they are.  Where they say evil in society, they also

saw the potential for reform.  They saw a grim present but

sought a brighter future.  Throughout their writings, they

explained their point of view.  They told people what they saw

was wrong, and told people how they might endeavor to make it

right.  These view truly were optimistic.<P>

     Yet they could not see through all this optimism and find

the flaws in their reasoning.  One of the flaws was saying that

man is at his best when he refuses to conform.  However, by

asking people not to conform, they were basically asking people

to conform to non-conformity.  More than this, however, they

were telling people how to not conform.  Thoreau says in Walden

"I say, let your affairs be as two or three, not a hundred or a

thousand . . . Simplify, simplify"<SUP>1</SUP> and "Cultivate poverty as a

garden herb"<SUP>2</SUP> and "Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts."<SUP>3</SUP>

Thoreau is merely saying that one should break from tradition

and follow no one, as long as it matches his ideas.  This is

merely conformity hidden behind a different guise.<P>

     Another flaw can also be found in the reasoning of the

Transcendentalists.  This group argued that the individual

tends to be good, while society as a whole is a source of evil.

This does make sense initially, if you take "the individual

tends to be good" as meaning that as well as usually being

good, the individual is also capable of evil.  With all of the

small amounts of evil brought together in one large society,

this small amount individually becomes a large amount in

society.  Yet this society should tend to be good, because all

of the individual good is also brought together.  So perhaps

the Transcendentalists are wrong:  either the individual is

evil and therefore so is society, or society isn't evil because

the individuals forming this society aren't.<P>

     The human experience throughout the ages tends to

discredit the second idea.  There is evil present in society.

The Transcendentalists saw it in their time and wanted to

reform it.  The Symbolists saw it and said that society

couldn't be reformed.  Evil can be seen in society today.  The
 
fact is, they are both slightly off the mark here.  Society

isn't all bad.  Society isn't all good.  Everyone has got the

potential to do good, but everyone also has the potential to

do bad.  Some individuals lean toward evil; others lean toward

good.  The Transcendentalists and Symbolists tended to

oversimplify these ideas, and that is where they went wrong.<P>

     The Symbolists, like the Transcendentalists, had their

own set of beliefs and ideas.  Their ideas, however, were

basically a rejection of any Transcendental ideas.  They

rejected the idea that man is innately good and said that man

tends toward evil.  Society wasn't the reason for evil, the

individual was.  Nature wasn't a spiritual force to them, it

was arbitrary.  They believed that social reform could not

work.  They saw life not as a spiritual journey, but as an

ambiguous mystery.  To them, life just was, and more than that

it tended to be bad.<P>

     In the eyes of a Symbolist, individuals tended to bad, and

their works reflected this.  In "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"

for example, all of the test subjects of the water from the

Fountain of Youth return to their evil ways after drinking it.

In Moby Dick Captain Ahab is bent on revenge, and even

Starbuck, who opposes Ahab's desire to go after Moby Dick only

for revenge, is motivated by money.  Society wasn't the source

of evil in these stories, the individual was.  Social reform

wouldn't work, believed the Symbolists, because society wasn't

the root of the problem.<P>

     As stated before, however, this is a narrow,

oversimplified view.  Society isn't the source of all evil

because some individuals tend toward evil.  However, on the

flip side of the token, some individuals who are good might be

influenced by society to do something bad.  Individuals can

both affect and be affected by society.  There is not a clear

cut answer to what causes the crime and evil in our society; it

is a complex question which has no simple answer.<P>

     Nature was another topic upon which both the

Transcendentalists and Symbolists gave their views.  Nature was

a good spiritual force as the Transcendentalists saw it.  To

the Symbolist, nature just was.  Here again they were both not

quite right.  Nature can be an important force in human life,

with all its majesty and beauty and awe-inspiring power.  Human

beings are a product of nature, of evolution.  This evolution,

though, has made humans social creatures.  In the beginning it

may have been for protection, or for safety, or so that they

might help each other in some way.  And today people can help

each other (isn't that what Thoreau was trying to do in

Walden?).  Society is not to be shunned, but neither is nature.

Both should be embraced, neither taken for granted.<P>

     Two major philosophies evolved in the mid 1800s.  One

belonged to the Transcendentalists, the other to the

Symbolists.  For the most part they were exact opposites, one

embraced what the other rejected.  The more perfect philosophy,

however, lies in between the different view of the two groups.

Neither was all wrong, but they did mess up in a few areas.

Studying these philosophies can lead one to find his own ideas

and maybe learn something along the way.<P>
