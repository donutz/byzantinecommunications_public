My fellow colonists:<P>
We have before us today a matter of grave and immediate importance. What I have to say is but one opinion, however, after exploring all other alternatives I can draw only one conclusion: We must not go to war with England! To do this would be a horrible mistake. It is not too late for us to achieve peace, not through war, but through talk and compromise. Nearly every obstacle to peace has been set up by ourselves, or rather, our patriot brothers. They would have you believe that what they do is necessary for "the cause"; yet if any among us are traitors, it is they.<BR>
Actions speak louder than words, and this is the very reason for our present situation. Our peaceful talks have been overshadowed by our Patriot brothers' ruthless acts of destruction and violence.<P>
Who among you would pay a premium for goods when the same could be purchased at a bargain price? Why then are there those who prepare for war, surely the costliest way to achieve peace? War simply is not the solution.
