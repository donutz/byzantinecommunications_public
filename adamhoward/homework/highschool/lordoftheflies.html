As novels go, Lord of the Flies is one filled with symbolism. From the entire island down to the smallest butterfly there is symbolism. The main characters each symbolize some aspect of humanity. The characters of Jack and Ralph can be compared and contrasted in a number of ways.<P>
One area where they differ is the way they chose to lead the boys. Ralph used a more democratic method, calling assemblies and voting on a situation. This method turned out to be unproductive. Jack, on the other hand, assumed total authority, like that of a dictator. Things were done his way or not at all. Jack would make decisions on his own, as demonstrated by his decision to beat Wilfred. Jack felt decisions should be made by one person, himself; Ralph felt everyone should help decide.<P>
Another way Jack and Ralph differed was the way they thought. Ralph thought practically; he used common sense. Throughout the story Ralph keeps bringing up the idea of the fire and keeping it going or they'd never be rescued. He complains that Jack should be helping with the shelters or doing something useful rather than going hunting. Jack, unlike Ralph, thought with and acted on instinct, hatred, and savagery; he insisted on unquestioning obedience. Jack was very savage; Ralph was very civilized.<P>
A way the two boys were similar in was the status they held among the boys. The main reason for their status was their stature, their heights compared to the other boys. Jack and Ralph were among the tallest boys on the island; therefore, the others saw them as the most adult of the group. The boys felt that adults had all the answers and would be able to cope with any situation. Because there were no adults on the island, the boys turned to Jack and Ralph.<P>
Jack and Ralph had many similarities and differences. They governed the boys differently. However, they were both looked up to. All of these characteristics and others contributed to the story of <I>Lord of the Flies</I>.<P>
