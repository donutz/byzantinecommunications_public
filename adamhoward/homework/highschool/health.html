<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Summary </TD><TD>In this paragraph, I will summarize the aforementioned article on the safety of drinking water. The purpose of this article was to increase public awareness of the possible threats lurking in tapwater. It discussed the quality of water, both at the source and after purification. It explained how runoff from farms and chemical spills and other sources can cause contamination not easily removed by filtering. It told of the dangers of lead poisoning and waterborn diseases. And it gave ways for you to help stop water pollution.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Reaction </TD><TD>This article helped to increase my awareness of where we get our drinking water, and how it can be polluted. I learned of flaws in the treatment and distribution systems and how they can contribute to pollution. I learned how pollutants, both biological and inorganic, can cause disease or poisoning. If I were to rate this article on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being lowest and 10 being the highest, I would give it a 9 because it was easy to understand and full of information.</TD></TR>

This article told how our nation's recommended daily allowance is in many cases not as high as they should be. It told how doctors around the country are learning as many people have long believed that higher doses of some vitamins can not only keep you healthy, but some can even help prevent diseases such as cancer. And it said in this new war on disease, you can find your weapons at your local drug store.</TD></TR>
