<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="2.">2.</A></FONT> The political thougth chart as we know it today had its origins in England during the 100 Years War. The king had been depleting his treasury, and he called a group of nobles together to be his advisors. In time, some of the nobles began to question the absolute power of the king. One meeting, when they came together, those who supported the king sat to his right, those who wanted change sat to his left. From this we get the terms right-wing and left-wing.<P>
Today, the political spectrum runs from the extreme right to the extreme left. However, most political groups active in government encompass a smaller part of it. The total spectrum, from extreme left (who demand a new (or no) government to the far right (who demand a return to times when things were better, perhaps to the system of 100 years ago) goes as follows: anarchist, radical, liberal, moderate, conservative, and reactionary (ultra-conservative). Most politics today in government range only from liberal to conservative. Liberals want change. They want it planned out, with a timeline, for example. Moderates are more conservative, but still support <EM>gradual</EM> change. Conservatives want to maintain the status quo, keep things as they are.<P>
Under Reagan, the parties polarized: Republicans became all conservative, the Democrats all liberal. Until that time, there had been a mix within each political party.<P>
The common view of the parties today is that the conservative Republicans are pro-big-business, and offer smaller taxes but consequently fewer government services. The liberal Democrats are seen as pro-labor, for the common man, and ask for higher taxes but more government services.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="4.">4.</A></FONT> Federalism is a method of government in which the powers of government are divided or shared between the national and local levels. The following chart explains the divisions of a federal government.<P>

Each of the three branches of government also divide power among themselves, so that a system of checks and balances exists.

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="5.">5.</A></FONT> Multiple causation is the theory which describes the events that lead to another larger event. Multiple causation simply means many causes. There are three kinds of causes: immediate cause, which is the event which sets things in motion; primary causes, which are the first causes, the most important causes; and secondary causes, which are less important. One event which shows the principle of multiple causation is World War I, which displayed an immediate cause as well as primary and secondary causes.<P>
The immediate cause of World War I was the assassination of  Archduke Francis Ferdinand. This is the event that set off a chain reaction, a domino effect, as country after country declared war.<P>
The primary causes relate to this cascade of war declarations, because one of the primary causes was the system of secret and entangling alliances in Europe. If a country would go to war, its allies would be obliged to help. Another primary reason was militarism. The arms race and struggle to have the greatest army produced military states, and if a war were to break out, it would give a chance to test their strength. Nationalism was also  a primary cause. The intense love for and devotion to one's homeland led many people to support their countries actions even if they were not right or just. Imperialism too was a primary cause; the desire for control of new lands, either politically or economically, led many nations into the war.<P>
There were also secondary causes to the war. One was an ethnic reason. People of the same heritage tended to group together. Similarly, countries withh political ties and similarities would fight together, as would nations with similar economic systems.<P>
In the ways shown above, it becomes apparent that World War I is an interesting example of the theory of multiple causation.<P>
