<STRONG>Whan that Aprill with his shour&euml;s soot&euml;<BR>
The droghte of March hath perc&euml;d to the root&euml;<BR>
And bath&euml;d every veyne is swich licour<BR>
Of which vertu engendr&euml;d is the flour,<BR>
Whan Zephirus eek with his sweet&euml; breeth<BR>
Inspir&euml;d hath in every holt and heeth<BR>
The tendr&euml; cropp&euml;s, and the yong&euml; sonn&euml;<BR>
Hath in the Ram his half cours y-ronn&euml;,<BR>
And smal&euml; fowel&euml;s maken melody&euml;<BR>
That slepen al the nyght with open eye,<BR>
So priketh hem Nature in hir corages,<BR>
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrymages,<BR>
And palmeres for te seken straung&euml; strond&euml;s,<BR>
To fern&euml; halw&euml;s kouthe in sondry lond&euml;s.<BR>
And specially, from every shir&euml;s end&euml;<BR>
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wend&euml;,<BR>
The holy, blisful martir for to seke<BR>
That hem hath holpen whan that they were seek&euml;.</STRONG><P>
