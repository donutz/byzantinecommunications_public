"Patterns of Love" is a metaphor explaining the family in the story, the Talbots. According to the story, the Talbots left tracks behind, like people walking through the snow, and they constantly crossed paths. Their lives were intertwined, anything that happened to one of them happened to them all. Their daily life was part of a large pattern, always repeating, even though the events of one day may differ from those of the next. Although each of the Talbots did their own, different things, they were  all caught in the endless "Patterns of Love."<P>
