              When Geoffrey Chaucer undertook the writing of The
         Canterbury Tales, he had a long road ahead of him.  He
         intended to tell two stories from each of thirty pilgrims on
         the way to Canterbury, and then two more from each pilgrim on
         the way back from Canterbury.  Of these, he completed only
         twenty-four.  However, in these tales, Chaucer depicts both
         the pilgrims and their stories with striking realism.  In
         "The Nun's Priest's Tale," "The Canon's Yeoman's Tale," "The
         Friar's Tale," "The Reeve's Tale," and "The Cleric's Tale,"
         Chaucer demonstrates his remarkable insight into human
         nature.  By comparing and contrasting these tales, one can
         see the universality of human nature as shown by Chaucer.<P>

              One human trait apparent in these selections is greed.
         Avarice drives the hearts of many men, whether they may be a
         common miller or a summoner or a supposedly religious canon,
         and Chaucer was aware of this.  In the tales which contain
         these three characters, Chaucer depicts the greed of these
         characters.  The Reeve tells his fellow pilgrims in his tale
         of a miller who "was a thief ...  of corn and meal, and sly
         at that; his habit was to steal" (Chaucer 125).  The summoner
         in "The Friar's Tale" "drew large profits to himself
         thereby," and as the devil observes of him in this tale,
         "You're out for wealth, acquired no matter how" (Chaucer 312,
         315).  The canon in Part 1 of "The Canon's Yeoman's Tale," as
         well as the Yeoman himself, had been driven by the goal of
         converting base metals into gold, and "though we never
         realized the wished conclusion we still went on raving in our
         illusion" (Chaucer 478).  The second canon of which the
         Yeoman speaks is many times worse than his own canon and
         master, using his trickery not merely in pursuit of making
         gold but also of stealing it.  The Yeoman explains that this
         greed, "the single minded pursuit of a trivial object can
         destroy a man," as it did to himself and his master (Whittock
         262).  But the second canon is well beyond this point.  "In
         all this world he has no peer for falsehood;" so selfish is
         he that he "infects" whole towns and robs them; so horrible
         is his greed that he can only compare with the traitor Judas
         who betrayed Christ (Whittock 270).<P>

              However bad a picture the Yeoman paints of this canon,
         the Friar creates this canon's near-equal in his own tale.
         This time the character is a summoner.  The summoner is
         unswerving in his greed even in the face of the devil, and as
         the Dictionary of Literary Biography says, "[he] tells the
         devil he may be good at what he does in his neck of the
         woods, but if he wants to see how it is done, he should watch
         the summoner at work" (140).  The devil of course does watch,
         and because the summoner will not repent for his lies and
         stealing, the devil proceeds to carry him off to Hell.<P>

              Condemnation does not come in such a dramatic fashion
         for the miller in "The Reeve's Tale."  His trickery against
         the clerks is repaid by the clerks' sleeping with his wife
         and daughter, as well as by being clubbed by his wife in the
         confusion the morning after.  His wife clubs him
         deliberately, not by accident.  She is tired of having a
         "husband who has been a cheat to his customers and is
         unworthy of her," and she is seeking a long-desired
         retribution upon her husband" (Balliet 2).  These reasons are
         added to the fact that "she knows that she has cuckolded him"
         and by knocking him out she may be able to hide her
         unfaithfulness (Balliet 3).  Through these tales Chaucer
         shows the universality of greed in human nature.<P>

              While in respect to greed these tales may agree, that
         greed is universal among humans contrasts with the widow of
         the "Nun's Priest's Tale."  She is described as poor and
         aged, and is "living a simple life on her small
         landholding" (Whittock 230).  She is not caught up in the
         race for wealth; she is not influenced by greed, but instead
         lives "an idealization of honest and contented poverty"
         (Fehrenbacher 138).  Chaucer shows that it is not just in
         human nature to be greedy in this tale.<P>

              Human nature as depicted in "The Nun's Priest's Tale"
         contrasts not only with the greed in some of the tales but
         also with what is depicted in "The Cleric's Tale."  In the
         former tale, Chanticleer, a rooster, is arguing with his wife
         Pertelote over the meaning of dreams, and in this argument
         one sees the all-to-real battle of the sexes.  In "The
         Cleric's Tale," however, Griselda, the wife of the lord
         Walter, is patient and tolerant to the extreme of everything
         her husband does.  This does not necessarily imply that wives
         should accept whatever treatment their husbands give, but
         that "Griselda's patient acceptance of the inscrutable will
         of her earthly husband may be taken as a moving example of
         how the Christian should submit to the Divine will," whatever
         may befall him in his life (Edden 370).  "If Griselda showed
         such patience to the will of a flawed earthly husband, then
         what patient submission ought the faithful Christian to show
         to the will of a loving and omnipotent God?" (Edden 370).
         This seems to be a fitting argument, since this tale is told
         by the Cleric.<P>

              While the Cleric's intelligence may have brought such a
         moral to his tale, intelligence is misused or even unused in
         "The Reeve's Tale" and "The Canon's Yeoman's Tale."  In the
         first, the two clerks have come to the miller intent on
         outwitting him using their superior intellect, so that "the
         miller couldn't rob them of half a peck of corn by
         trickery" (Chaucer 127).  The miller however frees one of
         their horses and having outwitted them instead, steals from
         their grain.  As Jeffrey Baylor observes:<P>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE> But while the two students do manage to regain<BR>
                   their grain, their horse, and have the sexual<BR>
                   favors of the miller's wife and daughter ... the<BR>
                   clerks, who were overconfident of their ability to<BR>
                   outwit the miller, find it necessary to 'lower'<BR>
                   themselves to the level of the miller's crude<BR>
                   nature (17).</BLOCKQUOTE>

         In the tale told by the Yeoman, the canon has much
         intelligence and knowledge, just as the clerics do.  However,
         he chooses not to put it to good use, instead wasting it on
         the vain search for easy riches, to satisfy his greed.  In
         these two tales Chaucer shows the failure of learning and
         knowledge.<P>

              While many of these tales do show facets of human
         nature, it is not just the tales but the purpose of the tales
         which shows human nature.  Many of the individual tales
         within The Canterbury Tales are not just told by their
         respective narrators to entertain the group of pilgrims but
         also in response to or in attack of the tales of other
         pilgrims or to provoke a response from another.  This shows
         the tendency of human nature for one to desire to have 'the
         last word.'  For instance, "The Reeve's Tale" is aimed
         directly at the Miller, who had told a vulgar tale of a
         carpenter, which offended the Reeve, a carpenter by trade.
         "The Cleric's Tale" is a response to the tale of the Wife of
         Bath, who had spoken of her ideal that women should be in
         control in a marriage; the Cleric tells a tale of a woman who
         accepts anything her husband says or does.  The tale of the
         Friar is aimed at the Summoner, and before the Friar ended
         his prologue the Summoner vows to repay him:<P>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE> Say what he likes, and when my turn's to come<BR>
                   I'll pay him back, by God! I'll strike him dumb!<BR>
                   I'll tell him what an honour it is, none higher,<BR>
                   To be a limiter, a flattering friar!<BR>
                   I'll tell him all about that job of his (Chaucer 311).</BLOCKQUOTE>

         In this way, Chaucer demonstrates his knowledge of human
         nature not just in each tale separately, but within the frame
         of the whole Canterbury Tales.<P>

              Chaucer showed the universality of human nature in
         many ways in The Canterbury Tales.  In several tales, he
         shows greed as playing a major part in human nature.  But he
         also shows that human nature is not all greed; in "The Nun's
         Priests Tale" he shows an old widow living in simplicity and
         poverty. Chaucer shows the relationships between men and
         women in his tales, as well as the role of knowledge.
         Through the whole set of tales, he shows the tendency for
         humans to have the last word.  Therefore, this shall be the
         last word; this paper ends here.<P>
