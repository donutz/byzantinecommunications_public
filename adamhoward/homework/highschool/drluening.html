Dr. Luening was not a good doctor; he always prescribed chain-saw therapy. He worked like a man with no heart. He also worked like a man with no brain. He was as blunt as a butterknife. He was a cruel, heartless person. He was an assembly line robot, working on one patient, then going to the next. He was a moth flying from one light to the next.<P>
