	The Roman Catholic priesthood has a long, long history. It all began with 
Jesus.  While Jesus was on Earth, he instituted the seven sacraments. One of
them was Holy Orders, the priesthood. The primary purpose of the priesthood
is to minister to the people and to administer the sacraments to the people. 
The Catholic tradition has maintained the purpose and form of the priesthood
much as Jesus intended.  The Twelve which Jesus chose to become the first
priests and bishops were all male. Throughout history, the priesthood has
changed, but changed little. The greatest change was the addition of a vow of
celibacy to the sacrament of Holy Orders. In addition, the priesthood (and
process of becoming a priest) has become more ritualized. This paper will
trace the priesthood from its inception, throughout history, and to the present
and beyond.<P>
	The priesthood began with Jesus.  During his three years of public
preaching, he chose twelve men from the crowd, men to be his disciples, his
students. At the time, they had no idea what they would ultimately learn, but they
still gave up everything to follow Jesus. He spent those three years teaching the
public, but also teaching His disciples, telling them things he did not reveal to
the crowd. He was training them through this whole time. Eventually, his time
on Earth drew close to the end. At this time, Jesus celebrated the Last Supper
with the Twelve. He broke bread and wine, as was tradition for Jews, but the
celebration was altered: He said to them, "This is my body ... This is my Blood
... Do this in memory of me." And with these words, the bread became His
Body, the wine his blood.  The next day, Jesus died. Three days later, he rose
again. And he continued with his Disciples, preparing them for the times when
He could not be with them in flesh. And He send the Holy Spirit down on them,
that they would continue what he had left unfinished.<P>
	The Twelve Apostles were the original bishops and also the original
priests.  They broke bread in homes in the name of Jesus, and they ministered
to the poor. However, their ministry attracted a great number of people.  They
could not do it all themselves.  And so they ordained other men to be priests as
well. These men also performed the Eucharist, the breaking of the bread, for
"Eucharist is 'the source and summit of the Christian life.'[134] 'The other
sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the
apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it'"
(Catechism, III.I.1324). <P>
	Throughout the years, the Apostles and their successors, the bishops of
the church, continued their work, and ordained more priests along the way.  "In
the early church, a lay person could advance" to any position within the Church
without first becoming a lower order (EB, vol 6 pg 21).  In this manner, a man
could skip deaconhood or priesthood and immediately become a bishop or
even pope, if he were so chosen.  In addition to their vocation, these priests
oftentimes had families of their own. And this lead to a few unwanted practices,
such as priests leaving Church properties to their heirs. Meanwhile, another
form of religious expression had emerged: the religious. These began as
hermits and then monks. These religious often were more holy than their priest
counterparts, and people started to go to see the monks and hermits for
advice.  The Church took note of this, and since these religious had vowed to
live a celibate life, the Church thought that perhaps the priesthood could benefit
from such a policy. So in the 4th century A.D., the Church began to enforce the
policy of celibacy for priests, and by the 12th century, any man becoming a
priest also took a vow of celibacy when he underwent Holy Orders. The
priesthood continued to remain celibate within the Catholic Church for the next
eight hundred years, and remains thus today.<P>
	In recent times, there have been many changes in thought concerning
the Church and religion. The second Vatican Council spearheaded this change
in thought.  This council changed many aspects of the Church but also
reaffirmed many.  One change was the removal of the necessity of celibacy for
deacons.  The current "rules" for becoming a priest in the Catholic Church are
to be a baptized male of the required age or older, have received a proper and
adequate education, "are of suitable character, and have a specific clerical
position awaiting him."<P> 
	In the present day, numerous controversies regarding priesthood have
come up. Among these are the belief that priests should not be made to
remain celibate. The critics to celibate priests argue that celibacy only
separates the priests more from the people they minister to. And to bolster their
argument, the Bible does not say that priests must remain celibate. Again, this
is a practice that began in the middle of the Church history. There is, therefore,
no reason, that priests should remain celibate.  The Eastern Orthodox Church,
which is closely related to the Catholic Church, allows married priests. It is
possible that in the future, parishioners will go to Mass on Sundays and the
priest may have a family of his own. <P>
	Some argue that the Church should allow women to become priests.
Unlike married male priests, this argument does not hold as much ground.
Because while Jesus did chose  married men among his Apostles, he did not
choose women. There is also the fact that in Mass, the priest takes the place of
Jesus in the ritual of the Last Supper, the Eucharist. Jesus was himself a man.
For this reason, a woman cannot adequately represent Jesus. So while it is
possible that non-celibate priests may be found in the future Roman Catholic
Church, women priests will not be found there.<P>
	The priesthood as formed by Jesus has evolved over the years to it's
present form, but has also remained mostly the same. Formed to minister to
the people of the Church and to give them the sacraments, including Jesus in
the Eucharist,  the priesthood has grown into it's present state over the
thousand of years. The priesthood will continue in the Church as long as the
Church exists, until the end of time.<P>
