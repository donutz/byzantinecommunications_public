Ed Valez, drug trafficker, thought this delivery would be like every other. He couldn't have been more wrong. This time, the buy was an undercover cop, and Ed was arrested. Faced with an overzealous D.A., an incompetent personal attorney, and a laid-back, donut-eating bailiff, Ed had very little chance of coming out innocent. When found guilty by Judge Al Cohall, Ed pulled a gun from under his jacket and fired at the undercover cop. Looking up from his donuts, the bailiff saw what Ed was doing, so he pulled out his gun and shot Ed in the heart. He claimed to have fired in self-defense, saying, "Look at the hole he put in this donut." Before he died, Ed Valez learned that crime doesn't pay, unless, of course, you invest in Disney and leave the country.<P>
