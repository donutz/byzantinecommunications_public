             Throughout the history of the Church there have been many
         truly great men and women.  Men such as Jesus himself, St. Paul,
         and the Apostles.  Surely one of these great men was Constantine
         the Great, the first Christian Roman Emperor.  Christianity had
         been spreading through the empire before Constantine, but what
         Constantine did for the movement was more than any Christian could
         possibly imagine.  Constantine's life had influence on his
         conversion, and after he came to Christianity following the Battle
         of Milvian Bridge, Constantine all but dedicated himself to the
         Church, evident through his issuing the Edict of Milan, his
         letters to the schismatic Donatists in North Africa, and his
         calling together of the bishops at Nicea.<P>

             When studying a subject, one should become familiar with some
         background information on the subject.  In this case, the
         background is that of Constantine's life.  Constantine was born
         Flavius Valerius Constantinus on February 27 of an unknown year in
         the late 280's AD, of Helena, a Christian woman of lowly birth
         from Bithynia, and Constantius, a officer of the Roman military,
         in the eastern part of the Roman Empire.  Constantius had to leave
         Helena and Constantine and to marry a step-daughter of Maximian in
         order to become a caesar (deputy emperor).  Nevertheless, he did
         not abandon Constantine completely, but kept an eye on him.
         Constantine spent much time in the imperial court, where he
         undoubtedly learned a bit about Christianity, which had become a
         major issue in the empire.  Constantius became co-emperor in 305,
         and brought his son to him in the western part of the empire,
         where they took an army into Britain.  Constantius was killed in
         battle in 306, and his army then proclaimed Constantine emperor.
         The empire was mired in a series of civil wars.  Finally, in the
         summer of 324, Constantine became sole emperor.  He was baptized
         on his deathbed, as was the custom back then, since Reconcilation
         hadn't emerged as a separate sacrament, and he wanted to have a
         clean soul when he died.  He died May 22, 337.<P>

             It was in one of these civil war battles that Constantine had
         an encounter with God that would change his life forever.  The
         year was 312, at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, in his campaign
         against Maxentius.  Constantine was given a sign by God, which
         Constantine carried into battle and won.  There are, however,
         differing versions of how the sign was given to Constantine. One
         version went like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>             "In our earliest authority (...written in 314, probably by
             the tutor of Crispus [Constantine's son]), Constantine was
             warned [by Jesus] in a dream on the night before the battle
             to draw the monogram of Christ upon the shields of his
             soldiers." (2)</BLOCKQUOTE>

         Another version, told by Constantine to his friend, Bishop
         Eusebius of Caesarea (a historian in the early Church) says that
         the sign of Christ appeared in the sky in front of the sun,
         surrounded by the words '<I>In hoc signo vinces</I>' - In this sign, you
         shall conquer.  This sign was plainly visible to both Constantine
         and to his troops.  As the author(s) of the passage on Constantine
         point out, this version was written down many years after the
         event, and Constantine could have been exaggerating.  A third
         version combines the previous two, with God showing the sign in
         the sky during the day, then during the night Jesus coming to
         Constantine in a dream, instructing him to put the sign on his
         soldiers shields before the battle.  Whichever version may turn
         out to be true, it is known that Constantine's army did go into
         the battle the next day bearing the sign of Christ on their
         shields and that they emerged victors, scoring a victory for
         Christianity.<P>

             As Constantine began his ascension to being sole emperor of
         Rome, he became more deeply involved in the workings of the
         Church.  In the year 313, Constantine met at Milan with Licinius,
         who at that time controlled the eastern half of the empire.  Out
         of this meeting came the Edict of Milan (or the Edict of Toler-
         ation).  By this decree, Christianity became an officially
         accepted religion in the empire:  not the state religion, but no
         longer illegal.  Some believe "that Constantine had already
         granted religious freedom and that...[the Edict] was intended only
         for the eastern portions of the empire where Licinius was in
         control." (2)  The detail, however, are not of great consequence;
         after that day, Christianity was accepted throughout the Roman
         empire.<P>

             As emperor, Constantine felt it was his personal duty to see
         that affairs of the Church went well.  Thus Constantine felt he
         had to do something when in the 310's a group of Donatists in
         North Africa came close to separating themselves from the Church
         on the grounds that they believed that priests or bishops who
         "fell away" from the faith could not be allowed back into the
         Church.  What he did was write a series of letters, from about 313
         to 320, to the Donatists, telling them they might find eternal
         damnation when the Last Judgement came, and also to the faithful
         of the Church, telling them to be patient with the Donatists, and
         that their suffering would be rewarded.  It was Constantine's
         belief "that a divided Church would offend the Christian God and
         so bring divine vengeance upon the Roman Empire and Constantine
         himself," (3) and so he did everything in his power to reunite the
         Church.<P>

             The Donatist schism was not the only controversy facing the
         Church in the time of Constantine, nor was it the greatest.  The
         Arian heresy, named after its leader Arius of Alexandria,
         maintained that Jesus, the Son of God, was created by God the
         Father, while mainstream Christian theologians believed that the
         Son was just as much God as the Father, and that both had always
         existed.  The basic argument came down to this: was the Son
         <I>homoousion</I> (of the same substance) with the Father, or was He
         <I>homoiousion</I> (of similar substance) with the Father?  Constantine
         first sent letters to Arius and his main opponent, Alexander (of
         Alexandria) and told them to resolve their insignificant arguments
         among themselves and let it go no further.  However, the situation
         got out of hand, and the only remedy Constantine could see was to
         call a council of the bishops of the Church.  There at in 325 AD
         Nicea, 300 bishops, many priests, and an abundance of lay people
         gathered, and Constantine himself presided over.  The outcome was
         the adoption by the Church of a new creed, the Nicene Creed, which
         reaffirmed the belief in the Trinity, emphasizing that the Son was
         always, is, and will be God, with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<P>

             Constantine had a major impact on the Church in the 4th
         Century AD, more important than many people might realize.  He was
         the first Roman emperor to embrace Christianity.  Not only did he
         himself become Christian, but he did many things to further the
         spread of the Church.  He converted himself to Christianity,
         setting an example for others.  He issued the Edict of Milan, the
         toleration of Christianity in the Roman Empire.  He helped to root
         out controversies in the Church such as the Donatist schism and
         the Arian heresy.  Constantine did all these wonderful things for
         the Church, and even though he is not recognized as a saint, he is
         known as a very great man who was a great help to the early
         Church.<P>
