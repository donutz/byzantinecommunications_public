	The writing style of Edgar Allan Poe can be compared and 
contrasted to modern society in many ways.  For instance, "Ed" 
often wrote about psychopathic (or psychotic) killers who would 
bury people in walls, as in "The Cask of Amontillado" (1) and in 
"The Black Cat" (2).  One can read about this kind of thing 
actually happening today by reading the daily newspaper.  But 
then, Poe's style can also be contrasted with today's society.  
It's not very often that a raven or any other bird for that matter 
enters some guy's room and says only one word to him before going 
and sitting on a bust above his doorway (3).  But chances are that 
Poe didn't mean for this poem he wrote to be taken literally.  At 
least, one wouldn't think that he meant it to be taken that way.  
One can never be too sure when one is dealing with a guy who 
married his fourteen year old cousin.  But that is beside the 
point.  The point is that although times and scenery have changed,  
Poe's works can still be related to society today.<P>

	One way in which Poe's works can be related to society today 
is his description of the characters.  An example of this can be 
found in Poe's short story "The Black Cat."(2)  In this story, the 
narrator starts out remembering a time when he was considered a 
"normal" person.  Gradually, due to his alcoholism, he becomes 
less concerned with those around him, more irritable, more moody.  
Just as he described so many years ago, people today, like the 
narrator in the story, drink alcohol and become irrational in 
thoughts and actions.  Eventually when the narrator tries to kill 
his cat, his wife stops him and he buries an axe in her head.  
Fortunately, one doesn't hear about this kind of murder all that 
often.  But people often do stupid things due to alcoholism, like 
drunk driving (although not all drunk driving is caused by 
alcoholism).  This is one of the ways that Poe's works relate to 
society.<P>

	Another way that Poe's work compares to the society of today 
by the characterization is found in the poem, "The Raven."(3)  In 
this poem, the narrator hears a sound which he thinks at first is 
coming from the door.  When people are frightened, they tend to 
try to come up with rational explanations for what is going on 
around them.  This is exactly what the narrator was trying to do.  
Also, having convinced himself that the sound was coming from the 
door, he tries to rationalize his reason for not answering it when 
the knocking first started.  These kinds of behavior can be found 
in people of any time period, not just the one that Poe wrote 
about.  And there's more.  Take a look in the next paragraph.<P>

	Yet another way in which Poe's writings compares to society 
today is again the people that he writes about, and the way he 
paints the picture of their characters.  In "The Cask of 
Amontillado," Montresor, the main character, turns out to be a 
cold-hearted killer who feels no remorse after walling his friend 
up deep in the basement (1).  Although most killers today probably 
wouldn't dispose of the body in the same way (namely, within their 
basement wall before killing the soon-to-be victim), many persons 
with homicidal tendencies feel no remorse for what they do.  In 
this way, Poe's work seems very much like society today.  However, 
not all people have homicidal tendencies, which is a good thing.  
So that could be a way in which Ed's writing contrasts with 
society today.  But that belongs in another paragraph.<P>

	And it's a funny thing, because this, right here, is another 
paragraph, and here a way in which Poe's writing contrasts with 
society can and will be discussed.  As mentioned in the above 
paragraph, not all people have homicidal tendencies.  Well, not 
all the people in Poe's stories do either.  But in a good deal of 
his stories, the main character or another character kills 
someone.  Like in the already mentioned "The Cask of Amontillado" 
(1).  The main character kills a friend of his.  In today's 
society, not a lot of people kill their friends, or they probably 
wouldn't have many.  Or any.  The point is that people today don't 
go around killing people like the characters in Poe's works.<P>

	Another way in which the writing style of Edgar Allan Poe 
contrasts with society is his use of imagery.  Granted, this 
cannot be directly contrasted with society, but indirectly it can.  
Poe uses his imagery in such a way that the reader can actually 
feel that they are present as the story takes place.  Usually, 
most people take their surroundings for granted, not realizing all 
of the details.  Poe's stories, however, describe things in 
greater detail than most people would notice under normal 
circumstances.  In this way, Poe's writing contrasts with society; 
people don't notice all of the details he tells about.  <P>

	Another way that Poe's work contrasts with society is in the 
settings of some of his works.  And not just in the obvious point 
that his stories take place in a very different time.  That point 
will not be discussed.  However, another way that the setting is 
different can be found in "The Fall of the House of Usher." (4)  
This story takes places in and around the House of Usher, a 
castle, moldy and decaying from age.  The action of the story 
almost always takes place as darkness is about to fall, there is 
never a lot of light.  The land around the castle is bleak and 
barren, the place is isolated somewhat by a moat.  This setting 
creates an eerie feeling and mood.  By contrast, there are few 
castles today, and even those that do exist are either uninhabited 
or they have been renovated to make the place more "livable."  No 
longer do people live in dark castles with wind whistling through 
cracks in the walls and around the windows.  The point is that the 
setting of some of Ed's works differ from the times and places 
most people today are familiar with.<P>

	Considering all things one now knows, one can see that there 
are many similarities and dissimilarities between Edgar Allan  
Poe's style of writing and the society of the world today.  
That is a pretty vague way of stating things, but it is true.  
One major similarity is the fact that the people that Poe writes 
about do actually exist, though they aren't especially numerous, 
depending on how you look at it.  A dissimilarity is the setting.  
The world isn't as gloomy as Poe makes it seem.  However, whether 
Poe's works are more like or unlike society today isn't something 
that can be told to a person.  One must decide this for one's 
self.<P>
