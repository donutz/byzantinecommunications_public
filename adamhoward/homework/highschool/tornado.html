Flying<SUP>1</SUP> over the town, Jerod was amazed by the damage and lack of it caused by the tornado. Near the south end of the town was a cornfield, most of the stalks had been blown down by the intense winds of the storm. Just north of the field was a small residential area, much of which had taken the full brunt of the tornado. A car lying on its side had a telephone pole driven through it, making it look like a giant shish-ke-bob. But a house across the street, except for a few missing shingles, was untouched. The town's business district to the north fared better than the residential area. Aside from a few shattered windows and downed power lines, things looked as they always had. And some houses several yards north left no sign that a tornado had come through. Looking over the devastation, Jerod was glad that he hadn't been in the town when the storm went through.<P>
