A spin-off of <DFN>Star Trek</DFN>, the popular television show and movies, <DFN>Star Trek: The Next Generation</DFN> is currently in its 6th season. Warping through the depths of space, the valiant crew of the <I>Enterprise</I> faces untold dangers on a daily basis (but they never go to the bathroom). <DFN>Star Trek: The Next Generation</DFN> offers a better outlook for the future from one perspective; from another it is a cool sci-fi show with nifty special effects. With its large audience and its running for six seasons, there was plenty of time and reason to write several exciting novels. In <I>War Drums</I>, by John Vornholt, the crew of the <I>Enterprise</I> must stop the violence between a group of young Klingons and colonists on the planet Selva before things reach disatrous proportions.<P>
An important element of this story is plot. When the <I>Enterprise</I> reaches Selva, the president of the colony explains that the Klingons live in the woods and occasionally attack and kill the colonists. Instead of exterminating the Klingons as the president wants, Captain Picard decides to try to befriend the Klingons and to arrange for peace. So Lt. Worf (a Klingon himself), Commander Data, and Councelor Troi go into the forest to accomplish that. They do befriend the Klingons, and learn that among the colonists is a traitor, tipping off the Klingons. And to top things off, they learn that the planet is violently unstable; the land surrounding the colony has been stripped of life only a few decades before it was settled. All these factors make for an exciting, suspenseful novel.<P>
In addition to the plot, the setting is also important to the story. The story takes place on planet Selva, a planet torn between extremes. Forty percent of it is covered with glaciers. The oceans have a deadly acidic film covering them and are heated by underwater volcanoes. The colony is located in between the two extremes, near enough the water to benefit from the warmth but far enough away to avoid the storms near the oceans. The two extremes of this planet symbolize the relationships of the Klingons and colonists; both are separated by great differences.<P>
No less important than plot and setting is theme. The author is trying to get across his belief that although peace is preferable to war, hatreds can run deep. Worf, Data, and Troi were able to buy the trust of the Klingons with food and luxuries the Klingons didn't have, with a reasonable degree of success. But after the atrocities the Klingons had committed, the least thing the colonists wanted was peace with them. This theme was the heart of the story, the reason the author wrote it.<P>
The plot, setting, and theme were all important to this novel. The plot adds excitement and builds suspense. The setting "sets the stage for the plot"; it symbolizes the main factions of the planet. The theme demonstrates the author's view on war. For those who like <DFN>Star Trek: The Next Generation</DFN>, or just like exciting stories, <I>War Drums</I> is a book well worth reading.<P>
