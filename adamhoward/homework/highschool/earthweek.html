When you think about recycling, what comes to mind? Glass? Aluminum? Paper? How 'bout underwear? Recycling, by definition, is to use again. This means that in past years, when Bill Clinton donated, among other things, used underwear to the Salvation Army, he was recycling. Hey, if Bill could do it, so can you. Recycle. It's that easy.<P>

Water -- pure, cold -- feels good on a hot summer day. You probably never realized that listening to your Walkman may be poisoning that water. Well, listening doesn't hurt, but tossing those old batteries can. Batteries can leak toxic chemicals, poisoning groundwater. So if you gotta have your music, use rechargeables. It saves money, resources, and keeps water clean and pure -- perfect for those hot summer days.<P>
