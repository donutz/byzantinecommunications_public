<DT><EM>Irony</EM><DD>Rainsford told Whitney, "Who cares how a jaguar feels?" and he ended up in the jaguar's position.<BR>Another irony is that Zaroff says he tries to be civilized, but he turned out to hunt humans (not very civilized to some).
<DT><EM>Conflict</EM><DD>The main conflict is person vs. person, Zaroff vs. Rainsford.<BR>Another conflict is person vs. nature, Rainsford has to fight his way through the jungle and swamp to escape Zaroff.
<DT><EM>Foreshadowing</EM><DD>An example of this is where Rainsford tells Whitney that they are lucky to be the hunters and not the huntees. Rainford did become the huntee.<BR> another is when Zaroff tells Rainsford that Ivan is savage, like all his race, and Zaroff turns out to be savage too.
<DT><EM>Personality from dialogue</EM><DD>Zaroff was telling Rainsford that life was for the strong, and that he (Zaroff) was strong, so why should he not be able to use his gift. To me, it seemed that Zaroff was a person used to getting his way, spoiled, in a sense.<BR>It also seemed that Zaroff bores easily, because he told Rainsford how he bored of hunting even large animals because they had only instinct.<BR>Indirect characterization through dialogue.
