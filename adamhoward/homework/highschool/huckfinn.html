In 1884, Mark Twain published the sequel to his critically
successful The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.  Rather than writing
the sequel as "another 'boy's book' in the light comic tone"<SUP>1</SUP>
in which Tom Sawyer was written, Twain took a different
approach.  He took it upon himself in this new novel to expose
the problems which he saw in society, using one of the most
powerful methods available to him.  The novel was The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; the method was satire.  The
beauty of using satire was that it was humorous with a serious
message, subtle yet powerful.  The novel was both a work of
humor and serious social commentary.  Twain uses generous
amounts of satire of man's cruelty to man, of religious
hypocrisy, of Romanticism, and of superstition in Huck Finn
both to amuse the reader and, more importantly, to make the
reader aware of the social "ills" which Twain saw at the time.<P>

     However, even since its publishing, the debate has gone on
over what Twain's purpose was in writing Huckleberry Finn.  One
school of thought contends that the book is merely a work of
humor.  Indeed, when it first came out, few took the novel to
be a work of the "social history of an era and the atmosphere
of a region"<SUP>2</SUP> and commentary upon this; the reading public
failed to see the commentary, and it was the humor and
adventure that carried the novel to success.<SUP>3</SUP>  In fact, some
even go so far as to say that satire plays no part in the
novel.  "David Burg...posits that this novel elaborates 'a
picaresque tale in the amoral fable form' and does not use
satire to reform any wrongs."<SUP>4</SUP>  This however is an extreme
view.<P>

On the other end of the scale, there are those who maintain the
novel is primarily satire used as commentary by Mark Twain.
"The truly profound meanings of the novel are generated by the
impingement [through satire] of the actual world of slavery,
feuds, lynching, murder..."<SUP>5</SUP> They do not dismiss the humor in
the book, but believe it enhances the story:  "Huck is a funny
book suitable for children, too, but the grownups who read it
will find depths in its humor and in its meaning."<SUP>6</SUP>  This
school of thought sees the satire in Huck Finn as social
commentary on the part of Twain.<P>

     Whichever view a person holds, it is difficult to say that
there is no satire in the novel.  The undeniable purpose of
satire is "to criticize or make fun of something bad or
foolish."<SUP>7</SUP>  Thus when Twain named the sinking steamboat after
Sir Walter Scott, or when Huck teased Jim after being separated
in the fog, he was not just making fun of anything; he was
making fun of some particular thing which he saw as being bad
or foolish.  Through The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the
readers eyes are opened to the things which Twain saw in
society and which he didn't like the looks of.<P>

     One wrong which Twain saw and didn't like was that a man
could be so cruel and inhumane to his fellow man.  Showing this
satire perfectly is treatment of Jim as he is being held by the
Phelpses.  In the story, Jim has been sold back into slavery by
the king, in itself showing cruelty of one man to another.  The
Phelpses are good meaning, well intentioned Christian people,
but society has taught them that slavery is perfectly alright
and that slaves are something less than people.  And so Jim is
treated accordingly:  locked up in a shed, although the
Phelpses do not leave him locked in solitary confinement the
whole time, as they were good Christians.  Yet it was not Mr.
or Mrs. Phelps who was most cruel to Jim, nor the king, who
sold him back into slavery, but Tom Sawyer.  Tom had needlessly
risked the life of Jim, who had already (though not to his
knowledge) been set free, which was the most cruel thing one
could do to him.  Indeed, almost the whole while they had the
ability to set Jim free.  In fact, they even let Jim out in
order to help move a grindstone into the shed:  "We see it
warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim.  So he raised up his
bed and slid the chain of the bed-leg,"<SUP>8</SUP> and after moving the
grindstone inside, "we helped him fix his chain back on the
bed-leg."<SUP>9</SUP> Tom put Jim through all this trouble even though Jim
could have gotten free right then.<P>

     After Jim escaped he was still treated with cruelty,
because of staying to help Tom, who was shot in the leg.  The
doctor who removed the bullet from Tom's leg explained to the
group of men how Jim had risked his freedom to help Tom.  "So
every one of the promised...that they wouldn't cuss him no
more.  Then they come out and locked him up."<SUP>10</SUP><P>

     Even Huck, who for most of the story was trying to help
Jim escape, was cruel to Jim.  Earlier in the novel, Huck and
Jim had become separated on the river in the fog.  Eventually,
Huck made it back to the raft, and found Jim asleep.  He
pretended to just wake up, and when Jim was surprised to see
him, he told Jim he hadn't been anywhere.  Huck convinces Jim
that he dreamed the whole thing, and Jim interprets the dream
to Huck.  Then Huck points out the broken oar and leaves and
trash, and as the "punch line" of his joke on Jim asks "but
what does these things stand for?" to which Jim responds "Dat
truck dah is trash, en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on
de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed."<SUP>11</SUP>  Huck was
ashamed and never again would be mean to Jim.<P>

     Twain used such satire to expose the situations faced by
blacks in those days; slavery had been abolished by the time
Twain wrote Huck Finn, but prejudice and racism hadn't.  In the
novel, satire is used as a vehicle for "shaping people's
awareness of the dynamics of racism."<SUP>12</SUP>  Also, through Twain's
depiction of African Americans, he provides the "potential for
satire...in the service of truth."<SUP>13</SUP>  W.H. Auden, referring to
Jim's escape, wrote "When I first read the book I took this to
be abolitionist satire on Mark Twain's part.  It is not that at
all."<SUP>14</SUP>  Twain was not trying to spread abolitionist propaganda
with this book but was pointing out the cruelty he saw against
blacks.<P>

     Nowhere, however, in the novel is the satire of man's
cruelty to man more predominant than the tarring and feathering
of the king and duke.  The two of them, who had been swindling
and cheating people during their entire stay with Huck and Jim
on the raft, were finally repaid in full.  Huck notes the
terrible cruelty of the situation:  "Human beings can be awful
cruel to one another."<SUP>15</SUP>  Not only does this point out the
satire of the situation, but it also is an epiphany for Huck,
and an underlying theme of the novel.  That however, is another
story.  Through this event, Twain points out that not just
crooks and criminals have the capacity to be cruel, but any
human being.<P>

     Closely connected in the novel to satire of man's cruelty
to man is the satire of religious hypocrisy.  A prime example
of this can be seen as Huck is staying with the Grangerfords.
Huck has Buck Grangerford explaining the Grangerford-
Shepherdson feud.  Huck's narration goes right from Buck saying
that the Shepherdsons don't breed cowards into "Next Sunday we
all went to church...The men took their guns along,"<SUP>16</SUP> and
finally into the preaching in church being about brotherly
love.  Brotherly love indeed, the Grangerfords carrying guns
along, ready to continue the feud on the way to or from church.<P>

     Satire of religious hypocrisy also shows up at the
Phelpses.  When Huck first arrived, he didn't know who he was
supposed to be that these people were expecting, and he made up
the excuse that the steamboat had blown a cylinder-head.

          <BLOCKQUOTE>"Good gracious! anybody hurt?" [asked Aunt Sally.]<BR>
          "No'm.  Killed a nigger."<BR>
          "Well, it's lucky...two years ago...the old Lally Rook...blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. He was a Baptist...I remember now, he did die"<SUP>17</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Aunt Sally thought nothing of a "nigger" who supposedly died,
but right away went into talking of a man who was killed once
in a similar accident, not forgetting to mention his religion.
So Mrs. Phelps became a vehicle for Twain's satire of religious
hypocrisy.<P>

     Mr. Phelps too was a vehicle for the same kind of satire.
Mr. Phelps (Uncle Silas) had paid forty dollars to hold Jim for
the reward, and left Jim locked up in a shed as if he were a
garden tool like a shovel or a hoe.  Yet "Jim told him [that]
Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him."<SUP>18</SUP>  The
only reason Uncle Silas comes in to pray with Jim is because
Silas hasn't really got anyone else to pray with, not because
he truly cares about Jim (as Huck does).  And so in this way,
Twain poked fun at all the religious hypocrites.<P>

     It was Romanticism, though, that seemed to be Twain's
favorite target for satire.  His most direct attack was aimed
at Sir Walter Scott, the Romantic writer.  Huck strands a gang
on a wrecked steamboat, and finds a captain to go out and save
them from the wreck.  "'What wreck?'  'Why, there ain't but
one.'  'What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?'"<SUP>19</SUP>  This shows
"Twain's obsession with Sir Walter Scott's influence on
Southern Culture...tallied in the name of the steamboat Huck
and Jim board in order to have an adventure."<SUP>20</SUP>  Yet their
adventure almost takes a turn for the worse, showing Twain's
belief that Romanticism can be a dangerous thing.<P>

     Less direct but seen more through the story is satire of
Romanticism through the character of Tom Sawyer.  "Twain
satirizes close-minded conformity" through Tom, who "does
everything 'by the book',"<SUP>21</SUP> and that book is always a work of
Romantic fiction.  Whether he is chasing a bunch of "A-rabs" or
keeping women for ransom in their cave -- "'Ransomed?  What's
that?' ... `Well I don't know.  But per'aps...it means that we
keep them till they're dead"<SUP>22</SUP> -- or making a rope ladder for
Jim's escape out of the ground-level shed, Tom does it just
like it is done in all the Romantic stories which he has read.
Through the satire through Tom, Twain depicts the
ridiculousness of Romanticism.<P>

     Twain also pokes fun through the character of Emmeline
Grangerford (deceased).  "This young girl kept a scrap-book...
and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient
suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write
poetry after them out of her own head."<SUP>23</SUP>  At first glance this
just seems very strange and odd.  However, Walter Blair tells
us that Emmeline Grangerford was based on the real-life poet
Julia A. More, who wrote such 'post-mortem poetry.'<SUP>24</SUP>  In this
particular instance, it is quite probable that Twain was not
criticizing, but rather just put this into the story in order
to get a good laugh out of it.<P>

     Twain used another target for his satire more because it
was funny than because there was something wrong with it.
This target was superstition.  At several points in the novel
Twain satirizes superstition, yet at others he seems to confirm
its validity.  It seems that Twain satirizes superstition up to
a point, since some superstition is grounded in folk-knowledge.
Twain recognizes the importance of superstition in
many people's lives, but that didn't stop him from satirizing
it.<P>

     One point where Twain tends to make fun of superstition is
after Huck and Jim were reunited after being separated in the
fog, and Huck convinced Jim that it was all a dream.  Jim "said
he must start in and  'terpret' it, because it was sent for a
warning."<SUP>25</SUP>  Another time Twain makes fun of superstition is
when Tom plays a trick on Jim as he sleeps, hanging his hat
above him on a tree.

<BLOCKQUOTE>          In the humorous vein, there is the belief expressed
          by Jim when Tom and Huck take his hat off and hang it
          on a limb:  'Afterward Jim said the witches
          bewildered him and put him in a trance, and rode him
          all over the state, then set him under the trees
          again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done
          it.'"<SUP>26</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

The other terribly superstitious blacks took in the story "so
favorably...that he enlarged the territory covered until the
witches 'rode him all over the world.'"<SUP>27</SUP>  Through these and
other superstitious encounters in Huck Finn (such as Jim's
hairball oracle), Twain satirizes superstition.<P>

     The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a humorous,
satirical book.  The sequel to Tom Sawyer, it was more than
just a spin-off, but was a complete story in itself, written in
an entirely different style:  "The language of Huckleberry Finn
was the form of humor which contained the serious issues Mark
Twain saw between 1878 and 1884."<SUP>28</SUP>  These "serious issues"
which Mark Twain saw were man's cruelty to man, religious
hypocrisy, Romanticism, and superstition.  Funny yet serious,
subtle yet powerful, Huck Finn is a novel which will long be
remembered for the messages which it presents.<P>
