<TT>Comment on the author's style.</TT> The author wrote much of thist story in a way that it was seen through the eyes of various characters, but in 3rd person.<P>

<TT>Why did you dis/like this author?</TT> I liked this author because you were left guessing as to who was the assassin until Worf found out himself, she created a suspenseful story.<P>

<TT>Why did you dis/like this story?</TT> I like this story because it put Worf, a Klingon, who is naturally an agressive, fierce, warlike person, in a position where he had to be the peacemaker, which was not easy for him.<P>
