Wooden spoons should not be used in the vicinity of an operating blender, especially when making milkshakes. For one thing, this is a good way to ruin a perfectly good spoon. Also, if the revolving blade catches the spoon, it can turn a milkshake into wood pulp. Most importantly, an estimated 73% of all blender-related injuries are cause by high-speed spoon fragments. So next time you make a milkshake and reach for that wooden spoon, remember what could happen, and ask yourself: Is it really worth it?<P>
