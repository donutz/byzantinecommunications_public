One of the most well-known books written by H.G. Wells, <I>The War of the Worlds</I>, is more than just a very good work of science fiction. Not only does it show how weak man might be in the event of an alien invasion, but symbolically it reflects how the white European men have regarded those of "inferior" races. In this case the aliens would be the European men; the humans would symbolize the "inferior" races. Like the Europeans, the aliens systematically wiped out those they considered inferior to make room for themselves and their "superior" civilization. Many literary elements were important to and supported this theme of the story.<P>
One important aspect to this story is point of view. This story was told in the first person, by a survivor of the alien invasion. The story (for the most part) is told from one character and what he went through. This point of view puts the reader in the narrator's shoes. The reader sees what the narrator sees, feels what the narrator feels, and hears what the narrator hears. This puts the reader in the midst of the action.<P>
Another important element ot the story is plot. At the beginning of the story, explosions on Mars were monitored, resembling gases streaming out of a barrel of a gun. However, little attention was heeded to this. When the first cylinder carrying part of the alien invasion force impacted in the countryside of England, it was regarded with little but curiosity. However, curiosity turned to fear when the true power of the aliens was revealed. After the country's best regiments were ruthlessly crushed by the aliens, it seemed as if human civilization had come to an end.<P>
No less important to the story than point of view and plot is its setting. The story takes place in southern England in the late 1800s, in the country around and the city of London. The weapons used by the men of the time did not stand much of a chance against the highly advanced weapons of the aliens. This played an important role in the story. Also important is the fact that the story took place on an island-country. This concentrated the threat posed by the aliens. Spread across the world the aliens would not have posed as great a threat. This story took place on an isolated place at a time when the weapons of man would have been far inferior to those of a civilization capable of travelling millions of miles through space.<P>
Central to this story was theme. The point of view lets the reader feel the intense fear that would be felt in such a situation as an alien invasion. The plot conveys the events and symbolizes actual happenings. Underlying the plot is setting, which helps to concentrate all of the actions into one place. Whether read for its underlying theme about humanity or for its graphic description of an alien invasion, <I>The War of the Worlds</I> is a novel that would be enjoyed by nearly anyone.<P>
