<p>In recent years, it has come to pass that if something offends someone, anyone, it isn't "politically correct," and it's got to go. One area under attack is religion in government. There are people fighting court battles to have "In God We Trust" taken off our coins and "one nation under God" removed from our pledge. Prayers have been banned in public schools, and crosses have been taken out of city coats of arms.</p>

<p>Separation of church and state isn't a bad idea. In fact, it's a very good one. It goes hand-in-hand with the idea of democracy. Democracy is the government of the peoople, not just one group, religious or otherwise, but all the people. Separation of church and state helps to insure that no one religous group will be more favored by the government than any other.</p>

<p>However, you can get too much of anything, good or bad. When a court decides a religous symbol must be removed from public property, who is the real winner? Will removing every spec of religion from government solve any of the real problems of society? Does this help the poor, the homeless, the hungry?</p>

<p>What we have before us is something of a wild goose chase. We aren't going after the real problems. We live in a democracy, where the overwhelming majority believes in some sort of religion. Is it wrong for our government to reflect this in any way at all?</p>

<p>All of this arguing has tended to downplay the importance of religion in our lives. What do we need religion for anyhow? Religion is just a boring class or an old priest teling us how to live, right? Yeah, and a house is a door surrounded by a wall. It's not the whole picture. Religion can help you form a sense of identity, of belonging. You can better yourself; you can getter society.</p>

<p>What good is removing God from another facet of our lives going to do for our society? God should be a part of your everyday life. God can help you but only if you let Him.</p>
