The stock market crash of 1929 marked a major turning point in the
history of the United States. Up to this point, the U.S. was in its greatest period
of prosperity; after this point, the U.S. plunged into its most severe depression.
The crash was brought about by many of the same devices that had made the
1920s so great.  The unregulated nature of the stock market was a major
cause of the crash. The overconfidence of the 20s influenced a search for easy
money, greed, which brought many new faces into a situation they did  not
understand. Also, the lack of a healthy fear in the stock market during the 1920s
manifested itself in the crash, emerging as a mad scramble as people,
corporations, and nations sank into debt and depression.<P>
An important factor of the crash of 1929 was the fact that the stock
market was unregulated. The government did not intervene, and many large
investors took this to their advantage. They ruled the market, and they used
several techniques to maintain their control and increase their wealth. One
such technique was "painting the tape." This involved several investors buying
into a company, then trading the shares among themselves. Small investors
would only see a stock on the ticker tape which was being heavily traded, and
so they would be interested in buying.  The large investors would then sell the
stock for a profit. Similar to this was pooling, in which large investors would
together buy a low-priced stock and sell it among themselves, artificially driving
up the price. They would then sell the stocks for a profit.  No longer did stock
prices reflect a company's worth. In fact, some of the large investors, rather
than buying a cheap stock, would invent one without a company behind it.
These unethical practices emerged in the unregulated environment which was
the stock market.<P>
Even with these unethical practices, there was a confidence in the
market. The belief existed that the market was near a state of perfection, that
the sky  was the limit, that the market could go nowhere but up. Everyone
wanted a chance at the easy money the market offered. Many plain folk took
their chances in the market. They "bought on a margin,"  meaning that they
bought stocks with borrowed money. So long as the prices went up, they would
be making money. But if the prices should go down, they could find themselves
deep in debt. Never fearing this, they bought into the market.<P>
This lack of fear would not last. There were those who saw the faults of
the market, the cracks in the foundation, the writing on the wall. In 1929, their
voices were heard. Some investors listened and began to sell. This was in
September. This time, the market was able to be stabilized. However, by
October 24, things were different. Many large investors feared that the market
might bust. So they sold. And they sold. And people saw them selling. These
people sold. This set off a chain reaction; everyone began selling out of fear, to
save the money they had placed so much confidence in.<P>
The crash of the stock market in 1929 changed the face of history in the
United States. The unregulated nature was a major contributing factor in the
crash. The overconfidence and greed of the 20s also contributed, as did the
fear that emerged after the investors realized that the market was not invincible.
All of these factors came together and the result was disaster: the stock market
crash of 1929.<P>
