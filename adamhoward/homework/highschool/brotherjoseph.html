Dear Brother Joseph<P>
I am on my way to America! I am so excited! The land of opportunity, just days away, but the minutes seem like hours and the hours like days! I can barely wait!<P>
How are things back in town? I am fine. I don't have much space, I share a cabin with 10 other people. The food is not very tasty, but it keeps me filled. Tell Mama I miss her cooking. None of it bothers me, though, because when we get to America, everything will be better. Everyone is happy, except for some of the crew. They have been on other ships crossing the ocean, and tell terrible stories. I'm not sure whether they can be believed or not.<P>
One of my cabin-mates gets up at the crack of dawn and watches the western horizon, even though we're still days away from landfall. Another watches the eastern horizon, remembering his family so far away. I know how they both feel. Torn between family and a better life. It is hard to leave. both say they plan to save to bring their families across, but they don't know how long it will be. I am glad we had enough money saved back at home. I will write as soon as I find a place to live. I miss you all, and hope to see you very soon.<P>

Dear Brother Joseph<P>
I know I told you I'd write when I got a place to live, but I had to write to you now. This Ellis Island is a very strange place, indeed. I've never seen so many people all moving in different directions, speaking so many languages. Everyone is going somewhere, and the only time they stop is for the examination, or if they have to wait for someone who is coming to meet them.<P>
Before they let you into the country, you have to be examined. They check your hair, they check your eyes, they check your skin. I didn't like it, but I guess they have to make sure no one brings diseases or bugs into the country. Standing in line, waiting, all I could think about was that I was going to be in America! I was so close, I could hardly wait!<P>
Once you get past the examination, you have to wait in another line. The line moved so slow! Finally, when I thought I couldn't wait any longer, I was at the desk. A man there spoke to me in German, but with an odd accent. He asked for my name, and where I was going. I told him I was going to work for the cabinetmaker in Pennsylvania. Then he gave me some papers, and said "Now you can go on your way." Finally, I was an American!<P>

PS As soon as I get to Pennsylvania I'll write again.

Dear Brother Joseph<P>
I'm in Pennsylvania now. I found the town where the cabinetmaker lives, and I got the job. Now I'm making cabinets! I am so happy! No, no, I am really, really very happy! I'm in the northern, eastern part of Pennsylvania. I help the cabinetmaker in a small town, near several large coal mines.<P>
The land is so different over here! They have all kinds of different trees, all kinds of different shrubs, all kinds of different flowers. Just two days ago the temperature got really cold, colder than I remember it ever getting back in Germany. It was raining, and it got so cold the rain froze.<P>
I found an apartment for us. It is small but cozy. It has two rooms plus a kitchen. I hope to see you very soon. I've got to go, we've got some work to do.<P>
<DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>Love<BR>Frederic Heisenburg</DIV><P>
PS I'm sending you along the address!<P>
