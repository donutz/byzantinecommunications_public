     I remember back to eight grade when I and some of my class- mates (whose names will appear later on this paper) had to, for art class (although, looking back, it may have been just and excuse for the teacher to play with his camcorder) make a movie (well, not really a movie, but like, some acting on tape, kinda like a movie, but not as long).  Anyway, the we got to choose the people we worked with, and we got to write whatever we were going to act (within reason, of course).  So together with my good friends Matt Beckemeier and Nik Gawin (rhymes with <SAMP>how-in</SAMP>) and also Bob "Boof" Frontczak, Craig Hotchkiss, Derek Mrotek, and Carrie "Metal-Tip" Kotecki, we started to work on what to do.  Actually, it was more of myself and Matt who decided what to do, and it was the two of us who ended up writing most of the script.  Nik also helped work on it, especially when Matt and I couldn't agree on what we should write.  Bob, Craig, Derek, and Carrie didn't do much else than act.  But we couldn't have done it without them.  After debating over what we should write the movie about, we finally decided to have it revolve around the arrest, trial, and finally the death of drug dealer Ed Valez  (Names of persons and events are fictitious.  Any similarity to actual persons [living or dead] or events is unintentional.).  This was definitely an experience worth remembering.  In the following paragraphs, I will tell about the experience of the making of the movie <I>(A Catchy Title Should Appear Here)</I>.<P>
     Why would I want to remember this particular experience, one might ask?  Simply put, it was worth remembering.  We had a fun time making it, and it was a good way to waste valuable class time.  This movie was as fun to make as it was to watch afterward.  It was a comedy.  Sometimes we'd have to try our darnedest not to laugh while filming it, and when we did laugh, we either had to edit it out or sometimes leave it it, because it would be either to hard to redo or leave it in becuase it was funnier than what we had originally intended to do.  Anyway, as we were making it we were constantly coming up with new things to do.  Occasionally, one of us would screw up, sometimes it would be funny, sometimes not.  One particular example was when Matt accidentally called Bob by his name instead of calling him Francis (the name of the character he played), and Bob suddenly started saying something along the lines of "Who is Bob?!  I'm not Bob! I'm Francis!  Do you see any Bob around here!?"  It was hilarious.  You had to be there.<P>
Sometimes we would have to improvise to make the movie agree with the script.  Like, the script called for Ed Valez to be locked up in the Knob Lick (this is the name of an actual city in Kentucky) County Jail.  Unfortunately, prison bars are kinda hard to come by in a school.  So we had to use a closet.  Anyway, I could go on for hours telling about the movie (although it was actually only 22 minutes long, including the credits [but it was still the longest in the class]).<P>
     Like I said, I could go on for hours, so I have to stop myself somewhere.  If you (or me, depending on who's reading this) wants to see the actual taped version of <I>(A Catchy Title Should Appear Here)</I>, you (or I) can't.  Not unless Matt and I can figure out if our eight grade teacher still has the tape he used to taped the movies from the class, and he hasn't taped over them (which is rather doubtful).  However, the original script still exists, as does a copy made after the taping which contains the modified script.  Anyway, I don't want to start talking (actually, typing) through the whole movie again, so this is where I'm going to end this.  I hope you (or I) found this interesting and that for myself as I read this, it brings back some good memories.  As I said before, this was an experience worth remembering.
