<I>We had to memorize verses 10 through 19 of Proverbs chapter 4, and then write it out from memory.</I><HR>
Hear, my son, and recieve my words,<BR>
and the years of your life shall be many.<BR>
On the way of wisdom I direct you,<BR>
I lead you on straighforward paths.<BR>
When you walk, your step will not be impeded,<BR>
and should you run, you will not stumble.<BR>
Hold fast to instruction, never let her go;<BR>
keep her, for she is your life.<P>
The path of the wicked enter not,<BR>
walk not on the way of evil men;<BR>
Shun it, cross it not,<BR>
turn aside from it, and pass on.<BR>
For they cannot rest until they have done evil;<BR>
to have made no one stumble steals away their sleep.<BR>
For they eat the bread of wickedness<BR>
and drink the wine of violence.<BR>
The way of the wicked is like darkness;<BR>
they know not on what they stumble.<BR>
But the path of the just is like shining light,<BR>
that grows in brilliance till perfect day.<P>
