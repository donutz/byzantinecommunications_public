In living things, homeostasis shares a close relationship with enzyme function. Enzymes can break up harmful substances that might disrupt homeostasis. And homeostasis maintains conditions necessary for enzymes to function. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss these two ways that homeostasis is related to enzyme function.<P>
Enzymes perform more than one function: some are involved in digestion, others in storing or utilizing energy, and some in maintaining a suitable internal environment, or homeostasis. It is the last group which I will discuss. These enzymes can attack substances, foreign or otherwise, and render them harmless. This can help keep a cell from being broken apart by some chemicals.<P>
On the other hand, homeostasis affects the way enzymes function. For example, if the pH swings out of the normal range for a cell, the acids or bases might denature the enzymes, changing their shape or breaking them down. A change in temperature can have a similar effect on the enzymes.<P>
In living things, buffers can help maintain a constant, suitable pH. Enzymes can eliminate foreign substances (like H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>). And different organisms control temperature in different ways (some rely on outside conditions to change internal temperatures, like a pig rolling in mud to cool off. Humans have sweat glands which use evaporation to cool them).<P>
In conclusion, you can now see why homeostasis and the function of enzymes are closely related. Enzymes help maintain homeostasis. And homeostasis keeps enzymes functioning. In these ways the two share a close relationship.<P>
