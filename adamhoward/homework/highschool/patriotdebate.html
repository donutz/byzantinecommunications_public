My Fellow Americans<P>
We have before us today a matter of grave and immediate importance. What I have to say is but one opinion; however, after exploring all other alternatives I can draw only one conclusion: We must end the tyrrany Great Britain has exercised over us, and the only way to do this is to go to war with England! The lines have been drawn, the war has begun.<P>
King George has kept us under the boot of tyrrany for long enough, and we must get out from under that boot before he crushes us with it. It has become clear that King George will not listen to reason. If war is what he wants, war is what he will get.<P>
Why did we leave England? We left to escape the very oppression and persecution we face today. It all began with taxes. Parliament claimed to have the right to levy taxes on us Americans, which they did levy. This in and of itself is not an outrageous idea, but it is unfair for us to be taxed by a body in which our interests are not represented! Parliament said we as English citizens must be taxed as any other British subjects, yet when we asked to be represented as other British subjects, we were denied. We petitioned for representation, they answered with taxes, no representation, more oppression.<P>
There is the golden rule: If they refuse to let us be represented, we refuse to represent their presence in America, namely by declaring ourselves independent.<P>
Our situation is no different than that of David and Goliath. Goliath challenged the army of Saul: "Choose on of your men, and have him come down to us. If he beats me in combat and kills me, we will be your vassals; but if I beat him and kill him, you shall be our vassals and serve us." Likewise the King of England proclaimed that since "The New England governments are in a state of rebellion, blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent. As the Philistines sent Goliath, so the King sends armies here. The Lord was with David, and so shall He be with us, we will prevail.<P>
The British once sent troops here to protect us from the French and Indians. Now, however, we do not need their troops to defend us, we do not need them at all. The need for defense is gone, the need for them is gone. Yet they continue to send troops. Why? I assure you that it is not to protect us, but to protect their interests. What of ours? Their Quartering Act forces us to house the messengers of our destruction. The king has abused his power at every turn. If left unchecked, he would have us in slavery in no time. By our hesitation to take action, we have allowed his power to grow to immense proportions.<P>
I have said before, the war has begun, men have been killed in the battlefields. But the killing is not even limited to the battlefields, take the Boston Massacre. <P>
We have come before the king, we have petitioned many times, and been ignored. Actions speak louder than words, and now is a time for action! The king has ignored peaceful solutions, but now he cannot ignore the reality of war.<P>
<I>Opponent takes their turn, rebuttling and presenting her own arguments.</I><P>
You say that we need protection from the French because of the French and Indian War, but that war is over. The threat of a French attack is gone. We have no need for your protection any longer. We can defend ourselves against the Indians; we can defend ourselves against you.<P>
The proclamation of '63 said no settling west of the Appalachians. Yet this land was claimed by our legislatures which consist of both patriots and loyalists. Why should we not settle this land? Do we let it sit unproductive?<P>
You say we are British, but we are Americans. You say we're rebelling, but not without reason. You told a touching story, but what we face affects us all. Do we live as slaves, or as the free men we are and should be?<P>
Isn't the God in heaven a just God? Then why would he side with the tyrannical English king? Your powerful army is not protecting us, but threatening us.<P>
And this, my friends, is why I believe that we should break away from England.<P>
