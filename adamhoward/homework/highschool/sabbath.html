In the hustle and bustle of today's world it is not uncommon for young people to forget the meaning of the Third Commandment, even if they do go to Church on Sunday.<P>
Here are several ways for these young people to get in touch with the spirit of the commandment, in no particular order:
<OL>
<LI> Drive a little old lady to Church. You've all seen them. Sure, they might want to go to the earliest Mass, but Jesus said getting to heaven might not be easy.
<LI> Recommend to the priest ways to make Mass more enjoyable. Surely there must be some way to do it, staying within what is reasonable.
<LI> Get involved. You don't have to be a priest to take part in Mass. You could read the Readings, carry up the gift; or if you don't like going in front of people, sing with the choir.
<LI> Do something nice for others. The Third Commandment doesn't mean you should do nothing on Sunday. Look at Jesus' example of healing the man's hand.
<LI> Do some good for yourself. In particular, look at how your decisions have or have not supported your values.
<LI> Let others do good for you. This may sound kind of selfish, but if someone admires you and wants to help you somehow, don't turn them away coldly.
<LI> Meditate. Use your time to get to know God better, to let Him into your life.
<LI> Be there for others. If someone has a problem, let them get it out. Sometimes just having someone to tell it to is better than any advice they may receive.
<LI> Start a Bible reading session. Take an in-depth look at the meaning of the Scriptures.
<LI> Hold a family get-together. Rest and have fun with everyone on a Sunday.
</OL><P>
With so many ways to get in touch with this commandment (and there are more than I have here) why don't you do something to get more involved on Sunday.<P>
