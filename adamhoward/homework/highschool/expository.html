Scenes showing the <I>USS Enterprise</I> moving against a background of starts on the television are made through a complicated process. A model of the <I>Enterprise</I> is filmed moving in front of a blue background which enables the filmmakes to place any background behind the ship. Then a matte of the model is filmed, which is necessary to block out the background on which the ship will be placed. Next the starbackground is filmed. Finally, all the images are compiled. This leaves the viewer with the starship <I>Enterprise</I> warping through space on the TV screen, fueled by a matter/antimatter reaction engine and plenty of imagination.<P>
