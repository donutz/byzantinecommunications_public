Throughout the centuries, men have pondered many great

questions. Among these is the question: "What is love?" There

is no doubt that the greatest name in English literature,

Shakespeare, sought to answer this question for himself.

Indeed, Shakespeare recorded his answer in many of the

sonnets and plays he wrote, including As You Like It. As

Shakespeare learned in seeking to answer this question, love

is many things, which in this play he observes through the

characters of the play, but most directly through Silvius:
   <BLOCKQUOTE>       It is to be all made of fantasy,<BR>

          All made of passion and all made of wishes,<BR>

          All adoration, duty, and observance,<BR>

          All humbleness, all patience and impatience,<BR>

          All purity, all trial, all observance ... (V.ii).</BLOCKQUOTE>

In this play, Shakespeare associates love with many

characteristics.  Love is often associated with selflessness

in this play. Part of the answer to the question of love is

also selflessness.  And an important part of love is truth.

Love embodies all of the greatest characteristics of a

person: truthfulness, selflessness, and faithfulness.<P>

     Part of love is selflessness. Throughout the play, many

of the characters demonstrate selflessness which in turn

reflects their love for one another. Orlando is one such

character. He and the ever-faithful Adam are wandering

through the forest of Arden, for Adam had warned Orlando of

certain death. Orlando's elder brother, Oliver, had harbored

a deep hatred towards Orlando, a hatred which had grown to

immense proportions. If Orlando had his home, he would have

been killed. Adam was able to persuade Orlando to flee, and

now they are in the forest. Once here, though, Adam can go no

further, for his is but an old man. "I die for food! Here I

lie down and measure out my grave" (Adam II.vi). Orlando

leaves Adam and finds a camp about to eat. Risking his own

life, he tells them not to eat any food, then explains why:

         <BLOCKQUOTE> There is an old poor man,<BR>

          Who after me hath many a weary step<BR>

          Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,<BR>

          Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,<BR>

          I will not touch a bit (II.vii).</BLOCKQUOTE>

Orlando is not merely being selfless, he is being selfless to

help out a servant, a member of a lower social class. There

are few names with such a reputation, and one of them is the

legendary Robin Hood. In this way Shakespeare shows the

selflessness of love.<P>

     Shakespeare through Orlando again shows selflessness,

this time not for a loving subordinate, but for his hateful

brother. Orlando is walking through the forest, and catches a

glimpse of "a  wretched and ragged man, o'ergrown with hair"

asleep at the base of an old oak tree (IV.iii). A snake

crawls down from the man, then slithers under a bush, where a

lioness crouches, ready to leap at the first movement of the

man. Orlando see the man to be none other than his elder

brother. "Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so [to

leave him there]/ But kindness, nobler ever than revenge ...

Made him give battle to the lioness" (IV.iii). Orlando

chooses to save his brother at great risk to himself, and is

indeed injured in the process. By placing the good, and even

more paramount, the life, of another before the his own good

and life, Orlando shows the greatest possible display of

selfless love that he can. It is interesting to note that as

Orlando approaches brother, the snake (a snake being a

traditional symbol for evil) wrapped around Oliver's neck

sees Orlando, and then quickly glides away; this is symbolic

that all hostility has left the relationship of the two

brothers. But the one thing that saves both Oliver and

therefore the relationship was Orlando's selfless love.<P>

     Orlando is not the only one to demonstrate a selfless

love for another. Celia, daughter of the usurping Duke

Frederick, tells of her love many times to her cousin

Rosalind, the daughter of the banished duke.

       <BLOCKQUOTE>   Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full<BR>

          weight that I love thee.  If my uncle, thy<BR>

          banished father, had banished thy uncle, the<BR>

          duke my father, so thou hadst been still with<BR>

          me, I could have taught my love to take thy<BR>

          father for mine (Celia I.ii).</BLOCKQUOTE>

More than just talk about her love for Rosalind, though,

Celia proves it by following her voluntarily into exile.

"Rosalind then lacks love/ which teacheth the that thou and I

am one/ ... No: let my father seek another heir" (Celia

I.iii).  Celia's love for Rosalind is so great that nothing

can separate the two; their love is stronger than the

"natural bond of sisters" (Le Beau I.ii). This love was

apparent to all who knew her, for as Charles the wrestler

mentions, Celia "so loves her ... that she  would have

followed her into exile" (I.i). This selflessness shown by

Celia is part of Shakespeare's definition of love.<P>

     Faithfulness helps form Shakespeare's definition of

love. Besides its mention early in the play when Charles

tells Oliver "how 'three or four loving lords' have given up

'lands and revenues' to go to the forest of Arden and live

there with the old duke in 'voluntary exile'" (Brown 75),

faithfulness can also be found later in the character of

Adam. Adam was once the servant of Sir Rowland de Boys, the

father of Oliver and Orlando. It is clear, however, that Adam

prefers Orlando, as he greets him as such: "What, my young

master! O my gentle master,/ O my sweet master, O you memory/

Of old Sir Rowland" (II.iii). Faithful both to his old

master's memory and his old master's son, Adam gives up his

life savings of five hundred crowns, which he had planned to

use to take care of himself in his old age, when his "old

limbs lie lame" (Adam II.iii). He hands it all over to

Orlando, asking only that he remain in Orlando's service.

Adam is faithful in the extreme. Through his character,

Shakespeare portrays love as faithfulness.<P>

     Shakespeare also shows the faithful aspect of love

through Orlando. Not always so dependable, Rosalind notes

that Orlando "Break[s] an hour's promise in love" (IV.i).

Rosalind, as Ganymede, however, teaches him better, "putting

Orlando through his paces as a suitor" and "instructing him

on the nature of true love" (Barber 233) (Vaughn 122). The

next time he arranges a meeting with "Ganymede" he is

determined not to let his Rosalind down: even after he saves

his brother from a lioness, getting wounded in the process,

he will not disappoint his Rosalind. Fainting from the loss

of blood, he sends Oliver to Rosalind with a bloody

handkerchief, to let her know that had circumstances allowed,

he would have come himself. This faithfulness to a person

whom he does not truly think to be the real Rosalind proves

that his love for Rosalind is true.<P>

     Truth, as Shakespeare saw, is an important part of the

definition of love. Indeed, real love is often called "true"

love. It is no surprise then that Shakespeare focused much on

this point, and even the exact opposite in this play.  In As

You Like It, there are several aspects of love as

truthfulness.  One such aspect is the questioning of the

quickness with which the couples in the play fall in love,

as to whether their love is true. Orlando asks Oliver, "Is't

possible ... That, but seeing, you should love her [Celia]?"

(V.ii). But "one can point out that it is really no swifter

than the speed with which Rosalind and Orlando fall in love:

all four couples experience love at first sight" (Barnet

120). However, by this point in the play, Orlando has learned

much about the nature of love with help from others, and has

found that he is truly in love. Part of Orlando's learning

experience was to learn faithfulness, another was to be true,

including in speech:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>    Orlando. Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.<BR>

          Jaques. Nay then, God b'wi' you an you talk in<BR>

             blank verse.                   (4.1.28-30)<BR>

          Here Jaques draws attention to Orlando's<BR>

          artificial mode of speaking (Lifson 95).</BLOCKQUOTE>

As stated, though, Orlando does catch on quickly and indeed

finds himself truly in love. Not all the rest of the couples

are so sure about their own love and its being true.<P>

     At first thought, it might seem that should Shakespeare

be writing about being true in love, that he is only making

matters worse by having characters in disguise interact with

other characters, including those whom they love and are

loved by. He is doing this, but more as well. by portraying

the exact opposite of his point in a humorous way, he is

serving to strengthen his own point. It is true that

Rosalind's disguise "complicates the plot, causing Phoebe to

fall in love with her," (Wilson 161) but Shakespeare gives

Rosalind these words with which she replies, "I pray you , do

not fall in love with me,/ For I am falser than vows made in

wine" (III.v). With this simple response, Shakespeare makes

an important point: for love to work, a relationship must be

based on truth. In this way, Shakespeare emphasizes the

truthfulness that is involved in love.<P>

     Included in Shakespeare's definition of love are

selflessness, faithfulness, and truthfulness. The actions of

Orlando and of Celia show selfless love. Orlando and Adam

display the faithful quality of love. Truthfulness of love is

emphasized by questioning the quickness of falling in love

and by the use of characters in disguise in the story. Taken

separately, each quality presents a fractional view of love,

but taken together, they form a more complete view of love,

love as Shakespeare saw it.</FONT><P>
