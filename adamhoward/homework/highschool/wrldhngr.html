     When examining any problem it is often most helpful to
look at it using the five 'W' questions:  what, who, where,
when, and why.  Then as a Catholic, one should see the
problem through a moral lens, judge it accordingly, and act
to correct it.  These principles can be applied to
understanding world hunger.  To understand what world hunger
is about, one can read the statistics and hear testimonials
of those who have been through it.  There are two who's in
world hunger:  those who live it and those who try to correct
it.  The place where it may be found, simply, is anywhere.
When world hunger is found is in the past and in the present,
and unless we do something to end it, in the future.  Why
world hunger exists is a simple question with a complicated
answer.  This essay will serve to clarify and answer these
questions as well as put the issue of world hunger underneath
my moral lens in my personal reflection.<P>
     What is world hunger?  To understand this question, one
must understand what 'hunger' is.  A simple definition of
hunger is "a strong need or desire for food." <SUP>1</SUP>  But such a
worldwide problem cannot be described in just one phrase.
There are numerous kinds of hunger which exist n this world,
experienced either singly or in combinations.  One is
undernutrition, in which the body does not take in enough
calories to sustain itself, maintaining ample body heat and
energy.  Another kind of hunger is malnutrition.  Even though
the body may receive enough calories, it is lacking in one or
more key nutrients, often due to the consumption of a single
kind of food, such as wheat or other grains.  Malabsorptive
hunger occurs when the body cannot extract the nutrients it
need, even if it does receive a balanced intake.  This is
often caused by intestinal diseases transferred though
unsanitary water.  Seasonal hunger can be found in areas
where the food supply runs out weeks or months before the
next harvest is ready.  In the extreme, hunger often takes
the form of famine, hunger in a large geographical area due
to a disruption in the growing/harvesting of crops, or
starvation, in which the body begins to consume its own
tissues.<P>
     If this is what hunger is, then what is world hunger?
It is the fact that "1 billion of us are chronically
undernourished; 13-18 million of us dead a year; 35,000 of us
a day; 24 of us (18 of whom are children) a minute." <SUP>2</SUP> (These
statistics came from a book published in 1985.  In Ending
World Hunger, published in 1991, the figure was increased to
40,000 children dying from hunger each day.) <SUP>3</SUP>  However,
statistics can only begin to tell the story of hunger.  Where
statistics leave off, personal experiences begin to tell the
tale.  These are the words of Kamala Markandaya, a writer
from India:
<BLOCKQUOTE>For hunger is a curious thing:  at first it is
with you all the time, waking and sleeping and
in your dreams, and your belly cries out
insistently, and there is a gnawing and a pain
as if your very vitals were being devoured and
you must stop it at any cost... Then the pain
is no longer sharp but dull and this too is
with you always, so that you think of food may
times a day and each time a terrible sickness
assails you and because you know this you try
to avoid the though but you cannot, it is with
you.  Then that too is gone, all pain, all
desire, only a great emptiness is left... and
it is now that the strength drains from your
limbs and you try to rise and find you cannot,
or to swallow water and your throat is
powerless... <SUP>4</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
    Malnutrition and hunger are even worse for children,
though.  Children experience stunted physical growth from
malnourishment, and "even if the malnutrition lasts only for
a short while, the lost growth potential can never be
regained." <SUP>5</SUP>  Still worse is the effect that malnutrition has
on the brain.  Mental development in early years is
drastically slowed by a lack f necessary proteins.  "Once a
child falls behind normal brain development, he cannot make
it up.  A short period of malnutrition results in below
average levels of intelligence." <SUP>6</SUP>  So it can be seen that
hunger is much more than an empty stomach.<P>
     Who then suffers from world hunger, and where?  The
answer, simply, is billions of people all around the world.
One billion people in this world are chronically malnourished
or undernourished, and still more receive enough to survive,
but not enough to thrive, to live a normal, active life.
These people live all around the globe; world hunger is
everywhere, not just in a far-off tropical nation, but also
right here in the US.  The hungry can be found within large
cities, but "the majority of hungry people live and work in
rural areas." <SUP>7</SUP>  Hunger is a major problem in most Third
World developing countries, such as Mexico, Ethiopia, India,
Peru, and in many more nations.  Hunger is not limited to
certain nations, hunger sees no borders.  Where there is
poverty, there is hunger, and where there is hunger, there
are people dying.<P>
     Hunger has existed throughout human evolution.  It at
first was a controlling factor of the size of the human race.
Then as agriculture was developed, a greater food production
allowed the population to grow larger, still, some people
went hungry.  In more recent times, however, hunger has
become much more prevalent.  And naturally, this leads to the
question:  Why is world hunger such a problem today?<P>
     There are many factors which contribute to world hunger.
Of these, some are agreed upon, some are disputed.  One cause
is past colonialism.  Included in this are the fact that the
colonizers may have brought ravaging diseases, the
exploitation by the mother country, and "as colonial systems
have weakened, the cutting of political ties with major
industrial nations has frequently been accompanied by a loss
of assured markets for exports or assured source for needed
imports." <SUP>8</SUP> Another reason is 'neo-colonialism,' in which a
multinational corporation indirectly controls some aspects of
a poorer country it does business in.  Massive debts also
plague many developing nations.  These nations "send more to
the West in debt payments than they get back in foreign
aid." <SUP>9</SUP>  Natural disasters can be a major cause of hunger,
and are often the "push that...turns malnourished populations
into starving ones." <SUP>10</SUP>  War is worse still, destroying land
and killing workers.  And money spent for military purposes
could be better spent on food.  "The value of arms imports
into the Third World has now climbed above that of grain
imports." <SUP>11</SUP><P>
     Some believe that overpopulation is a cause of world
hunger, and in some locations, this is true.  However,
overpopulation is more often the result of extreme poverty
and hunger.  "[Poor] couples want large families because more
children often means more workers to earn money or raise
crops for the family." <SUP>12</SUP>  Some say that there is not enough
food in the world to feed all the people.  But "everyday, the
world produces 2 pounds of grain for every man woman and
child on earth.  That is enough to provide everyone 3,000
calories a day, well above the recommended daily minimum of
2,300 calories." <SUP>13</SUP>  So overpopulation is not so much of a
cause of world hunger as the disproportionate supply of food
is.<P>
     If these reasons tell why there is world hunger, then
who is doing anything to stop it?  People all around the
world are.  Foreign aid come in 3 basic forms:  Bilateral
aid, "the direct transfer of goods and services from one
government to another" <SUP>14</SUP>; multilateral aid, "contributions
from several countries to an institution, which then
allocates the assistance to the recipient." <SUP>15</SUP>; and aid from
private volunteer organizations (PVOs).  There are several
multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations
Development Program.  Some PVOs are Catholic Relief Services,
UNICEF, CARE, and Oxfam.  All of these institutions provide
aid in numerous ways, such as loans or money transfers, as
well as both short- and long-term solutions, including
"agricultural training, food aid, construction, and
educational programs." <SUP>16</SUP><P>
     After reading and learning about all of the facts
surrounding world hunger, I have a few things which I would
like to say.  I was surprised to learn many of the things I
read, such as the fact that every day, 40,000 children die
from hunger or hunger-related diseases, not just people, but
children.  I was also surprised to learn that Third World
countries buy more arms than they do food from foreign
nations.  However, I do disagree with some of the facts
stated.  One in particular is end note 13, about the amount
of grain produced daily.  This two pounds per person per day
doesn't take into account that the world has to feed more
than human mouths; there are animals like cows and pigs that
need to be fed too.  These animals can provide more protein
than plant materials can, either as milk or meat.  Therefore
I thought that fact was a bit misleading.<P>
     I now after doing all this research understand better
what a problem hunger is around the globe, and even though I
know that every bit helps, I do feel a little helpless to
stop it.  And besides that, when you ask people what they
think about world hunger, many don't know much about it or
don't think about it or don't care about it, making the
struggle to eliminate it that much more difficult.  So we can
see that the problem will be difficult indeed to stop.<P>
     Sometimes I wonder whether humankind will ever
eliminate global hunger.  Jesus himself said that we will
always have the poor.  Still, as Catholics, it is our
obligation to help correct this problem.  So whether or not
we can stop world hunger is not the point, the point is that
we must do all that we can to try to stop it.  And just
sending money to the affected areas is not all that we can or
should do.  We must help these people to help themselves,
teach them and allow them to function viably on the global
market.  We can't allow ourselves to view the problem as too
big to handle.  We can conquer global hunger if we all come
together.<P>
