They, whoever they are, say that truth is stranger than 
fiction.  It's also a lot harder to explain than fiction.  
Take spontaneous human combustion (Abbreviated as SHC. In 
German it is <DFN>spontan menschlich verbrennung</DFN>).  Put simply 
(or simply put) SHC is a phenomenon in which a person 
suddenly bursts into flames for no apparent reason, burning 
at temperatures up to and exceeding 3,000 degrees 
Farhenheit.  This can be a health hazard.  Why, in just the 
last 400 years, there have been more than 200 reported cases 
of SHC, making for an average of one case every two years.  
And the particulars of each occurrance can and do vary 
greatly.  Although there are many theories attempting to 
explain the causes for SHC, none can explain every fact from 
every case.  Difficult to explain and just as hard to 
understand, spontaneous human combustion is mysterious yet 
very interesting.<P>

With all the different aspects of each case, it is 
difficult to fully explain each without ending up with a 
long, very dull, boring report, so here are some of the more 
intriguing aspects:<P>

<UL>
<LI>In SHC, human bodies can be reduced to a pile of 
ashes.  Not just the flesh, but also the bones.  Under 
any normal circumstances, this would take temperatures 
in excess of the already mentioned 3,000 degrees.  
Relatively speaking, that's pretty hot.
<LI>Sometimes the whole body isn't burned to ashes. 
Sometimes an unburnt leg, finger, or foot may be 
found lying in a pile of ashes.  That is pretty weird.
<LI>Even more weird is the fact that very little, if any, 
of the surroundings are affected.  A charred corpse 
may be found on an unburnt bed.  Yet there's no 
evidence that the body was placed there after being 
consumed by flames.
</UL><P>

This list could go on and on.  But it doesn't have to.  The 
point is that even this short listing can demonstrate how 
mysterious a phenomenon spontaneous human combustion is.  In 
fact, the only way to better show how mysterious it is would 
be to give a description of an actual case.<P>

As a matter of fact, giving such a description of a case 
of SHC isn't such a bad idea.  This one is particularly 
interesting, because it is one of the few cases where every 
possible scientific investigation tool	was used, but the 
cause of death was still labelled "inconclusive".  The 
events went as follows:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>July 1, 1951<BR>

Mrs. Mary Reeser, a 67 year old widow
living in St. Petersburg, Florida, went to her 
son's home (also in St. Petersburg) to visit.<P>

In the evening she stayed at the house with her 
grandchildren while everyone else went to the 
beach.  When the family returned, Mrs. Reeser
had already left the house to go back to her 
own apartment.  Her daughter-in-law went to 
Mrs. Reeser's apartment to see if everything 
was O.K.  Apparently it was, because, according 
to her later testimony, she said that everything 
seemed O.K.<P>

The last person to see Mrs. Reeser alive was her
neighbor and landlord, Mrs. Pansy Carpenter.  She 
saw Mrs. Reeser around 9 P.M., apparently to say 
good night to her.<P>

At approximately 8 A.M. the next morning, Mrs. 
Carpenter signed a telegram for Mrs. Reeser and 
went over to her apartment to give it to her.  To 
her surprise, the doorknob was hot.  Being a woman 
of reasonable intelligence, Mrs. Carpenter determined 
that this was not good.  She yelled for help, and 
two people painting across the street.  One of the 
two opened the door, and saw a little smoke and a 
small flame on a wooden partition.  He went into the 
apartment, but he could not find Mrs. Reeser.<P>

The Fire Dept. arrived later and put out the small 
flame with an extinguisher.  The wooden partition 
was removed and behind it was found something so
strange that it deserves a paragraph of its own. <P>

Sitting in the middle of a charred area with a
2 ft. radius were several blackened chair springs,
a pile of ashes, a shrunken head, a charred liver 
stuck to a piece of spine, and a foot still wearing 
a slipper.  Mrs. Reeser was dead.  Her estimated
body weight of 175 lbs. was reduced to less than 
10 lbs.  Little else in the room other than her chair 
was touched by fire.  The upper wall was covered in an 
oily soot, and the plastic wall outlets there had 
melted.  But that was about it.<P>

The case was investigated by many arson experts, 
including Dr. Wilton Krogman, who was experienced 
in the effects of fire on cadavers. ("Hey, Wil, what
are you gonna do when you grow up?"  "I'm gonna burn
dead people.")  Along with the FBI, police and fire 
officials, they were stumped.  As a top arson 
specialist from the National Board of Underwriters 
said, "I can only say the victim died from fire..."<P>

Finally, they all gave up; they could do no more to 
explain the death.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Needless to say, SHC is pretty mysterious, especially after	
looking at an actual case of it.<P>

However mysterious something is, though, someone is 
always going to try to come up with a rational explanation.	
There are many theories that try to explain SHC, such as:  
fats and oils in the body can burn under certain 
circumstances, static electricity could set the body on 
fire, and alcoholic beverages can make a person's breath 
flammable.  (These are the more "tame" theories.  Some of 
the more exotic ones attribute SHC to geomagnetic flux, 
internal atomic explosions, high frequency sound, and the 
like.)  Of course, "in 1851 a German chemist pointed out 
that overweight imbibers of brandy generally do not burn 
when they are close to a fire."  Well, duh.  We can only 
speculate as to his research methods...<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Chemist</STRONG>:  (Sees a fat drunk walk from a bar.)  Excuse
me, how much did you have to drink?

<LI><STRONG>Drunk</STRONG>:  Um, uh, (Looks at hands) well...

<LI><STRONG>Chemist</STRONG>:  Nevermind.  Would you come stand by this Bunsen burner?

<LI><STRONG>Drunk</STRONG>:  Sure.  (Walks over.)

<LI>(Nothing happens.)

<LI><STRONG>Chemist</STRONG>:  Darn, I was hoping you'd burst into flames. Oh well, Thank-you for your time. Cheerio.
</UL><P>

Of course, the preceding conversation probably never took 
place.  The point is that no one theory for SHC has ever 
been proven and probably won't be for a long time.<P>

Spontaneous human combustion has puzzled a lot of people 
for a long time.  The at-risk group for this is any 
breathing person.  However hard it is looked at, there is no 
apparent reason for SHC.  No explanation (or combination of 
explanations, for that matter) has ever been proven.  For 
the answer to this vexing question, which remains a mystery, 
it seems that the world will have to wait for just a little 
(or maybe a lot) longer.<P>
