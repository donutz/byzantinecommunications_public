The story "The Necklace" has an ironic tiwst at the end of it. Mme. Loisel had always wanted to be rich, with large dining halls, great banquets, and the like. So, naturally, when her husband got an invitation to a ball she wanted to look stunning. Her husband gave her money to buy a dress, but when she told him she needed jewelry to go with it, he told her to borrow some from a friend. Her friend let her borrow a diamond necklace, and she was the best dressed person at the ball. When she returned home from the ball, however, she noticed the necklace was gone. She could nto find it, and ended up buying a brand new necklace to replace it. For 10 years she and her husband worked to pay off the debt; at the end of this time, Mme. Loisel was a different person, aged by the rough life and grown accustom to it. At the end of the story she meets the owner of the necklace who at first does not recognize Mme. Loisel. Mme. Loisel explains what had happened with the necklace to her friend, who looks at her with astonishment. She tells her the necklace was only costume jewelry, worth a fraction of the necklace that replaced it. Mme. Loisel had wanted to wear the necklace to make herself look rich, but instead she got 10 years of poverty.<P>
