              "In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the
         earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness
         covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the
         waters." <A HREF="#One"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  There was a time when the United States federal
         government kept a balanced budget.  It was not back at the
         beginning of time, although it does seem very far off.  The
         year was 1969, the last year when the federal government
         either met its budget or came through with a surplus for the
         fiscal year.  Since that time, things have taken a turn for
         the worse, going for the most part downhill.  The purpose of
         this paper is not to give a five page definition of the
         balanced budget amendment, nor its complete history from "the
         beginning," but rather to present the arguments on both sides
         of the issue, that the reader may see for his/herself the
         merits of such an amendment, and ultimately make his/her own
         decision.<P>

              In order to form an opinion on the issue, one must have
         an understanding of it.  In the simplest terms, the balanced
         budget amendment would prevent the government for spending
         more money than it takes in each year.  The amendment was to
         go into effect in 2002, allowing the government seven years
         to adjust to the new regulations, able to spend no more than
         it takes in, unless three-fifths of both houses of Congress
         voted to run an unbalanced budget that year, or in cases of
         wartime.  The last amendment to the Constitution was adopted
         May 7, 1992, "prohibiting a congressional pay raise from
         taking effect during the Congress in which it was adopted." <A HREF="#Two"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
         This would make a balanced budget amendment the twenty-eighth
         to the Constitution.<P>

              The debate over the balanced budget amendment has been a
         tough one.  It has been a debate of partisan bickering, of
         principals, of rhetoric and of empty words.  "[The House]
         approved the measure 300-132," <A HREF="#Three"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and was slated to come
         before the Senate at the end of February.  The first vote in
         the Senate fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority.
         A final vote was delayed for a day, then another.  The
         results of the final vote were 65-35, just two votes short of
         the 67 needed to pass the amendment through the Senate.  One
         of these votes belonged to Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
         in order that he would be able to bring the amendment back
         before the Senate at a later date.  The amendment will surely
         be back.<P>

              Why does the country need an amendment to the
         Constitution to balance the budget?  Some say there is no
         need for such an amendment, that it can be done the "old-
         fashioned" way.  But the "old-fashioned" approach has always
         been a viable option, yet "in the last 35 years, the United
         States has run a deficit 34 times." <A HREF="#Four"><SUP>4</SUP></A>  It seems that common
         sense is a commodity in short supply in the federal
         government.  Why does the country need a balanced budget
         amendment?  It needs the amendment because Congress hasn't
         got the guts to balance the budget the "old-fashioned" way.
         It will force Congress to balance the budget.<P>

              Many lawmakers opposed the amendment on the grounds that
         balancing the budget would require cutting benefits to the
         middle class, such as cuts in Medicare or Social Security.
         Supporters of the amendment say that this is not the case.
         Even so, the possibility could arise, and this was enough to
         provide "cover for uncommitted senators to vote against the
         amendment."<A HREF="#Five"> <SUP>5</SUP></A>  It is true that balancing the budget would
         require that tough choices be made.  The balanced budget
         amendment could be the shot in the arm the country needs:
         it may sting a bit at first, but will protect against worse
         situations in the future.  Social Security amounts to a
         massive part of the yearly budget, nearly half, and together
         with all the "other mandatory spending programs, combined
         with interest on the national debt, will eat up all annual
         revenue by 2012." <A HREF="#Six"><SUP>6</SUP></A>  Tough choices have got to be made.
         The government (including President Clinton) has got to stop
         just throwing money at problems.  Money doesn't make the
         problems go away.  Action does.  The balanced budget
         amendment would necessitate such action.<P>

              Most senators would like to reduce the deficit, to take
         some action.  It seems, though, that they have different ways
         of expressing this.  Senator Herb Kohl (D-Wis), who was in
         favor of the amendment, stated, "The need for the amendment
         is the result of too much rhetoric and not enough action."<A HREF="#Seven"> <SUP>7</SUP></A>
         However, Senator Russ Feingold, also a Wisconsin Democrat,
         believed that the balanced budget amendment would only delay
         action for seven years, and so he voted against it.<P>

              Had the founders of this great nation known that this
         issue would someday come forward, they surely would have
         included it in the Constitution.  However, what appeared to
         be common sense back then has turn out to be something
         completely different today in government.  With the
         amendment not likely to come up in the Senate again until
         1996, the only option left to balance the budget is to do it
         the "old-fashioned" way.  However, this approach has failed
         in recent years past, and with tax cuts and increased
         interest on the debt and more, it will be even harder this
         year to trim the budget.  But if the Congress wants to
         maintain an approval of the people, they will have to find a
         way to reduce the deficit.<P>

              The struggle for a balanced budget has been a tough one.
         Partisanship, petty bickering, empty rhetoric all got in the
         way of the amendment this year.  Congress appears to have
         lost its resolve on this issue.  The amendment may hurt a
         bit, but as they say, "Whatever doesn't kill you can only
         make you stronger."  This balanced budget can make the
         country stronger.  The decision is in the hands of the U.S.
         Senate, but ultimately, it is in the hands of the U.S.
         citizens.<P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Letter I had to write for the assignment:</H4>

         Senator Russ Feingold<BR>
         502 Hart Senate Office Building<BR>
         Washington, D.C. 20510-4904<P>

         Dear Sir,<BR>
              I would like to voice my opinion on the balanced budget
         amendment that you may consider this when it next comes
         before the Senate.  I believe that the balanced budget is a
         good idea, and since you voted against it before, I will try
         to explain my reasoning to you.<P>
              I understand that you voted against the amendment
         because it would delay any action for 7 years.  This is not
         necessarily the case.  Besides, it is a step in the right
         direction.  Congress has been unwilling or unable to balance
         the budget without an amendment; the amendment would provide
         a motivating force.<P>
              Also, concerning social programs like Social Security,
         eventually, something has got to be done.  Cuts here won't be
         liked by many, but may be necessary.<P>
              I'm certain that you have already thought about all this
         and more, but you are my senator, and I'm sure that you are
         glad to hear from those you represent.<P>
                                                            Sincerely,
<HR>
