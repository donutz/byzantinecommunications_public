<h1 class="center">Adam's <strike>HoemWurk</strike> Homework Page!</h1>


<p>So for whatever reason I did it....I did it. I took all my old essays and 
  research papers, converted them to HTML and threw them on my web page. What did I hope to achieve by doing this? Do I want people to copy the papers, put their own name on it, and turn it in? Nah, I'm not a big fan of cheating (if you are, go to the <a href="http://www.cheathouse.com">Evil 
  House of Cheat</a>, they've got all kinds of papers for you to steal). </p>

<p>I do enjoy getting an email every once in a while letting me know how my old    homework has helped someone out. Sometimes my paper turns out to be good for a list of references (so go ahead and dig away at my Bibliographies), and sometimes, someone even appreciates what I've written, and cites *me* in their paper. Now that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>My papers cover a pretty wide range of topics, so go ahead and look around. 
I broke it down by the year I wrote the stuff, not by the subject. Just to make    it a little harder on you. Make you do some researching or something. Man, I   wish I'd had the Internet when I started writing papers...all I had was the local college's electronic catalog of scholarly journals that would give you topics on &quot;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: of Mice and Men&quot; when you're trying to find journal articles on a John Steinbeck book...lousy catalog....</p>
