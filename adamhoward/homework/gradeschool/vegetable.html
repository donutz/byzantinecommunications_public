To grow your mutant veggies, first get 2 gallons of snail slime. To the slime add 4 squished squirrels right off the road. Next put this mixture immediately into the washing machine with some moldy socks. Save the mixture.<P>
After leaving the mixture sit for two days, go get a barrel of toxic waste from a toxic waste dump. Then take the barrel home and dump it in a 1,600 gallon flowerpot with your mixture and a seed of your choice (Venus flytraps grow best). For best results throw in your ex-wife's lawyer.<P>
When your plant first pushes up through the sludge, give it twelve-hundred gallons of nitroglycerine. For the rest of the first two weeks you feed it 2 sticks of dynamite. For the rest of its lifetime give it 16 sticks of dynamite per day. Then you will have a full grown Giant Mutant Vegetable.<P>
