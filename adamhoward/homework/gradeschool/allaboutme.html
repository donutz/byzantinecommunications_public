I used to look like Jon Syverson's brother,<BR>
but now I look more mature.<BR>
I used to play with my neighbor,<BR>
but now I lie on my bed and do nothing.<BR>
I used to hate the taste of baked beans,<BR>
but now I hate it even more.<BR>
I used to be afraid of the basement,<BR>
but now I'm afraid of a 747 falling on my toes.<BR>
I used to believe thunder was angels bowling,<BR>
but not any more.<BR>
I used to not be able to cross the street,<BR>
but now I can go lots of places on my bike.<BR>
I used to get in trouble for fighting with my sister,<BR>
and up to now, that hasn't changed.<P>
