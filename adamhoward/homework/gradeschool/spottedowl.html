(The northern spotted owl was placed on the Fish and Wildlife Service's threatened species list on June 22, 1990.)<P>
The northern spotted owl, or Strix accidentalis, lives in old-growth forest of the Northwestern United States.<P>
The northern spotted owl is about 20-24 inches tall, with the females slightly larger than the males. These owls weigh about one to three pounds. On their backs they have whitish spots and on their underside they have one inch long white horizontal bars. (Since I have given a description I have decided to use the picture on the cover of the <I>Time</I> magazine for my cover picture).<P>
The northern spotted owl feeds mostly on small rodents and small birds. They carefully watch and listen for their prey, and when they have located it, they swoop down silently and grab them.<P>
The northern spotted owl nests in holes of trees in old-growth forests. Two to seven eggs are laid, and they are incubated for fifteen to thirty-five days. The young owls then spend the next twenty-four to fifty-two days in the nest, after which they fly with their parents for a few weeks before finally leaving on their own.<P>
The fact that the northern spotted owl lives and nests in the old growth forests of the Northwestern United States has been the source for much controversy. The timber industry and loggers say there is no use for these forests. The environmentalists say these forest help clean the air and even the smallest change, such as one species dying out, can have a great effect on the environment.<P>
Saving the forests and the owl could cost the timber industry at least 20,000 jobs, if not more. But saving the forests and the owl would also make the world more livable for future generations. What should <EM>you</EM> think? Well, no one can make that decision except <EM>you</EM>.<P>
