Planet Orgon was recently discovered by an American satellite which was going to Mars. When it photographed the sun a strange object appeared on the picture. We now know that this object is in Earth's orbit and is very similar to Earth. We named this planet Orgon.<P>
As I mentioned before, Orgon occupies Earth's orbit, on the exact opposite side of the sun. Considering this you may think that Orgon is very similar to Earth. And it is.<P>
An Orgonian day is slightly shorter than a day on Earth. An Orgonian atmosphere contains: 6% CO<SUB>2</SUB>, 60% Nitrogen, 30% O<SUB>2</SUB>, 4% of other gases. The atmospheric pressure is 1010 millibars at the surface. The surface is covered with 80% water and 20% land. Orgon has 2 satellites, which are still known as Moon 1 and Moon 2. As far as we know, there are no inhabitants but tiny microorganisms.<P>
