<LI> The Newbery Award was named for John Newbery, an eighteenth century English publisher. The award was named for him because he was one of the first to publish children's books. The Award is given by the Children's Section of the American Library Association for the most outstanding US children's book for the previous year.<P>
<LI>I think that this book was worthy of receiving the Newbery Honor Award because Rufus, even though he lived in the time of World War II, is what most children his age are like. What I am saying is that Rufus is a child to which most children can relate. This book received the Honor Award in 1944.<P>
<LI>No, I could not find any other way that this book was honored with any awards.<P>
<LI>Do your days seem long and boring?<BR>
Well, if they do, let Rufus Moffat spice them up. Learn that when he was only a little boy, he could only fit Rufus M. on his library card and it stuck. It stuck so much, in fact, that this is the title of the book.<BR>Also learn about the Invisible Piano Player, the Cardboard Boy, Rufus' best friend and worst enemy, and how when he pinch hit for the Fatal Four, he made home run and saved the game for them. What happens, you ask? Well, to that question, there is only one answer: Read the book!<P>
