The following is a report on <I>West Side Story</I>, explaining how it went, and who the characters were.<P>
The movie starts out where the two gangs are dancing around. They meet at a basketball court and a fight breaks out.<P>
The cops come in and break up the fight.<P>
The Sharks (one of the gangs) is told to leave. After they leave, Riff, the leader of the Jets, decides that the two gangs should fight each other.<P>
Riff leaves and meets Tony, the former Jets leader, who is also doing work, and they talk for a while.<P>
Then Anita and Maria are in a room getting ready for a dance.<P>
Later at the dance, Tony and Maria start to dance, and then some singing starts.<P>
One of the gangs gets together after the dance and talks.<P>
A cop comes in and gives a warning to them, then leaves.<P>
The gangs sing "Gee Officer Krupke," then goes into the drug store. An older man talks to them for a while, then the gang leaves. <P>
Maria is with some women and Tony comes in. They sing "One hand, one heart."<P>
After that the gangs meet to fight. Tony comes in to try to make sure that only fists, not knives and guns, etc are used.<P>
The two leaders try to fight with knives. Tony ends up killing Maria's brother and the other leader is killed.<P>
Chino goes to Maria and tells her what happened.<P>
The gangs finally start to cool their tempers.<P>
Tony and Maria agree to meet at the drug store. maria finds she can't make it, and asks Anita to meet Tony and tells him why.<P>
Anita doesn't end up telling him and Chino says that Maria's dead.<P>
Tony wants to try to kill Chino, but Tony ends up being killed.<P>
This movie was based on Shakespeare's <I>Romeo and Juliet</I>.<P>
(The reason I haven't got all the information you wanted is that with all the people talking I couldn't hear what was going on in the movie. On top of that, the movie kept going from bright to dim pictures, which made it even harder.)<P>
