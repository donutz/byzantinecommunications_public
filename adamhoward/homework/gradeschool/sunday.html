(This story takes place on a warm Sunday afternoon in the spring of 1645. The place is in the home of Joseph and his family.)<P>
Joseph: You mean to tell me you took a one hour walk on a Sunday? Did anyone see you?<P>
Elizabeth: No, Father, no one saw me.<P>
Joseph: Are you sure, Elizabeth?<P>
Elizabeth: Yes, Father, I am sure that no one saw me.<P>
Joseph: But what if someone did? They might notify the leaders and you could be taken away. You know the laws.<P>
Elizabeth: I know the rulse. I just lost track of time.<P>
(Mary, Elizabeth's mother, comes in.)<P>
Mary: What's all the commotion about?<P>
Joseph: Our daughter took a one hour walk today.<P>
Mary: Did anyone see you?<P>
Elizabeth: No, Mother, no one saw me.<P>
Mary: I'm just worried about you because if you were taken away you might be placed with someone you don't like.<P>
(Joseph decided to change the subject.)<P>
Joseph: Jacob, come down here, it's time to read from the Bible.<P>
(Jacob comes down the stairs to the living room, where they all settle down in front of the fireplace. Joseph starts to read about the creation in the book of Genesis.<P>
Jacob: Is that how God really created the world?<P>
Joseph: Something like that. Otherwise it would not be in there.<P>
Mary: Well, Elizabeth, it's time to prepare dinner.<P>
Elizabeth: Yes, Mother. I'll go get the food out of the storeroom.<P>
Joseph: Elizabeth, wait a second. As long as they have these laws, don't break any more, alright?<P>
Elizabeth: Yes, Father.<P>
