The theme above was one which we had for an assignment. We received a sheet with this theme and some thing that fit it. We were to choose and do one of these things.<P>
The one I chose was to help a friend with chores or homework. I was unable to help this person with chores, but I did help them with homework. The following will tell why I chose this one, and what I did.<P>
The main reason I chose this one is because I knew it was something I could do. This isn't the greatest of reasons, I could have at least tried to do something else, but I didn't. The other ereason is that I knew the person I chose to help might have been in need of help.<P>
After choosing to help someone with homework, I told this person to tell me if they needed help. Later this person told me they did need some help. It happened to be at the end of the week, so we decided to get together on Sunday. After church on Sunday, we went to this person's house. A short time later we got to work.<P>
This is how I helped the person. First we read the question. Then I'd help them to find the page. This person would read until they found it. I tried to keep from telling them yes or no if what they chose was right or wrong, sometimes if they reread the question, that would help them.<P>
Yes, I do think that this fits our theme. A person could give all the answers to someone, but that wouldnt' help them, it would hurt them. by giving someone the answers, chances are that the person wouldn't learn anything, they could just write down all the answers. If they got a test, they would know how they came to the answers they had. They also might not remember the answers, it is usually true that if you do something many times, you'll probably remember it better. This person didn't really do it then, they would have just written them down and that would be the end of it.<P>
In conclusion, you should be able to see that I did give one of the best presents.<P>
