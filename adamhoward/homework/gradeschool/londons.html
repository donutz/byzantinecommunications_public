<TT><B>Essay: Describe the two types of Londons.</B></TT><P>
In the following essay, I will describe the two types of Londons.<P>
One of the Londons is what the tourist sees. This one has the old building such as the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. It has the old churches and chapels, and has museums housing historical objects. It is historical Britain, the part the tourist would want to see.<P>
The other London is the center of trade, industries, and services. it has a good location for trade with Western Europe. It is a major international banking and insurance center. It is the location of many industries, such as food processing, printing, aerospace, and electronics.<P>
As you can see, although London is but one city, it's divided into two distinct parts.<P>
