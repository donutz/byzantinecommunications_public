Lisa turned around. The blind was no longer over her window. The night showed black through the windowpane. A half moon hung low in the sky.<P>
Lisa screamed . . . . the face . . . . it was there, too. Lisa fainted and fell to the floor.<P>
He lowered his mask, then knocked on the window. "Hello, Strangest Puzzle Services, does a Lisa live here?"<P>
When Lisa didn't answer, he pushed up the window and crawled in. He noticed the box on the table. On his way to the table he tripped over Lisa, fell against the table, and sent the puzzle pieces all over the room.<P>
Just then Lisa woke up. "Who are you, and what are you doing in my apartment?"<P>
"I'm Super Jerod, and I'm here to protect you from the monster in the puzzle."<P>
"Huh?"<P>
"Okay, okay, so I'm the one who goes around scaring people and getting the puzzle back."<P>
"If you're Super Jerod, like your name tag says, what are you doing here?" she asked.<P>
"I have a name tag? Well, would ya look at that. It's neat how they engraved my name in it, and . . ."<P>
He was interrupted by LIsa's cough.<P>
"Oh, yes, this is what I do when I'm not off fighting bad guys. Now, getting back to business, would you like me to take the puzzle now, or would you like to keep it and put it back together again, because I could always come back with my mask and do this again . . ."<P>
"No thank you," Lisa said.<P>
Whatever you say," said Super Jerod, gathering the puzzle pieces from the floor. Within two minutes he had left.<P>
Lisa felt tired, so she went to bed. When she woke up, she thought it had all been a dream. But when she found the puzzle pieces lying in the corner with her face on them, she knew that everything had been real.<P>
