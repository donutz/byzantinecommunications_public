	<LI>Had Holmes <EM>corroborated</EM> enough clues to solve the mystery before it was too late?
	<LI>What did the <EM>post mortem</EM> examination of Sir Charles Baskerville's body reveal?
	<LI>Had Sir Charles died of <EM>chimerical</EM> hallucination, or was there something real that had literally scared him to death?
	<LI>Was the young <EM>baronet</EM> (Sir Henry) doomed to the same fate as his uncle, Sir Charles?
	<LI>If Sir Henry <EM>implicitly</EM> followed Holmes' instructions, would the mystery be solved?
	<LI>What was Holmes' plan when he left the <EM>rueful</EM> Sir Henry and supposedly went back to London?
	<LI>Why had Mr. Stapleton <EM>dissuaded</EM> Mrs. Laura Lyons from keeping her appointment with Sir Charles?
	<LI>What was the meaning of Mrs. Stapleton's <EM>merriment</EM> after she had been taken out of the binding put on her by husband?</OL>
<LI>One clue was the footsteps (footprints, rather) left by Sir Charles in the Yew Alley at Baskerville Hall. These indicated that he had been running from something.<BR>
Another was the letter of warning to Sir Henry cut out of The Times. This led Holmes to believe that Mrs. Stapleton was against what her husband was doing.<BR>
A third was the ashes left from Sir Charles' cigar at a gate. Dr. Mortimer (a friend of Sir Charles) deduced from these that he had been waiting at this spot for five to ten minutes for someone or something.
<LI><UL>
	<LI>What? - Sir Charles Baskerville died of a heart attack when he saw and ran from what appeared to be a supernatural hound.
	<LI>Who? - Mr. Stapleton had set the hound out to kill Sir Charles.
	<LI>Where? - Sir Charles died in the Yew Alley in Baskerville Hall.
	<LI>When? - He died around midnight, June 4<SUP>th</SUP>, in the early 1800s.
	<LI>Why? - Mr. Stapleton, who was really a Baskerville, wanted to be the heir to everything.</UL>
<LI>If this mystery were to be made into a radio show, the following sound effects would be used:
<UL>
	<LI>The howling of a hound, heard a few times on the moor.
	<LI>Sounds of running footsteps, when Sir Henry was chased by the hound.
	<LI>Sounds of footsteps creeping on a wooden floor, when Barrymore was checking for the escaped convict, who was related to his wife.
	<LI>Rattling of wheels of a horse-drawn carriage, when Watson came to Devonshire with Sir Henry.</UL>
