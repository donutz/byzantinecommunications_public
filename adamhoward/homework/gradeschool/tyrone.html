Ring...ring...ring...<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> [Picks up phone] Hello?<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Hello, this is Tyrone from Tyrone's Used Car/Car 

        Wash. When would you like to pick up your car?<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> I'll be there in a few minutes.<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Heh, heh, I'll be ready.[Hangs up phone.]<P>

<STRONG>Narrator:</STRONG> A few minutes pass.<P>

[Stan and Tyrone at the car wash.]<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> Where's my car?<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> What color is it?<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> Blue.<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Well, then that would be in the blue section.<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> [Puts on a surprised look] Muh, muh, my car!<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> What kind of car was it?<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> A PORCHE!<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> My boys did a good job then. They gave yours 

        the royal treatment. Usually they don't even look like a car.<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> Do you have any idea how much this car cost me?<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Oh, maybe about 95 thousand dollars.<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> That's right! Why did you destroy it then?<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Well, it's like this......<P>

[Alien fleet comes in, Tyrone and Stan switch to surprised faces.]<P>

<STRONG>Stan:</STRONG> My GOD! What is it?!?<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Maybe they wanna go through the car wash. Hang on, I'll be right back. [Tyrone goes and gets a sign that says, ALIENS GET CLEANED FOR FREE.]<P>

[Aliens hover to waste time - 10 seconds, aliens come close to ground.]<P>

<STRONG>Aliens:</STRONG> We are going to use your car wash. [Stan gasps, 
                                                            
        turns around, and loses his head as he faints.]<P>
                                                            
<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Hang on, let me get it started up.<P>                  

[Tyrone starts up car wash, aliens go in....(Styrofoam) peanuts come out.]<P>

<STRONG>Tyrone:</STRONG> Heh, heh, I still got the touch.<P>
