<LI><KBD>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</KBD><BR>
<KBD>Author's Name:</KBD> The name of the author that I chose was Washington Irving.<BR>
<KBD>Place of birth:</KBD> Irving was born in New York City, NY.<BR>
<KBD>When did the author live?</KBD> Irving lived from 1783 to 1859.<BR>
<KBD>Where was he/she educated?</KBD> No information was given on his education.<BR>
<KBD>First published work: (title)</KBD> Irving's first published works were letters that ridiculed New York society, printed in the <I>Morning Chronical</I>, a New York City newspaper. <KBD>(date)</KBD> The dates were from 1802 and 1803.<BR>
<KBD>Type of writing author is known for: (ex: poetry, history, novels)</KBD> Washington Irving was known for his humorous stories and satirical essays.<BR>
<KBD>Works by this author you have read:</KBD> I haven't read any of Irving's works but some of them are <I>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.</I>, <I>History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus</I>, <I>Bracebridge Hall</I>, and<I> A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty</I>, often called <I>Knickerbocker's History of New York</I>.

<LI><KBD>Did the author write about the time when he/she lived or about another time? Give at least three examples.</KBD> Irving wrote about his own time in A Tour on the Prairies. He wrote about the past in <I>Knickerbocker's History of New York</I> and in <I>History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus</I>.

<LI><KBD>Are the locations of the author's stories placed where he/she actually lived? Give at least three examples.</KBD> Yes, he did write about where he lived in some books such as <I>The Sketch Book</I>, but for some books he wrote about other places, as in <I>The Conquest of Granada</I> and <I>The Alhambra</I>.

<LI><KBD>Does the author use experiences from his/her own life in any of the works written? If yes, give at least three examples.</KBD> Yes, he does write about his own experiences in <I>A Tour on the Prairies</I> and <I>Tales of a Traveller</I>, but he doesn't in some books, such as <I>The Conquest of Granada</I>.

<LI><KBD>Find out what people or events had the greatest influence on the author. Then tell how he/she was influence.</KBD> Washington Irving was influenced by many people, and if i had to choose who had the most influence over him, I would have to choose the society of New York City. He was influenced just by living there, and seeing how they lived. I say this because he would write about them in some of his letters and books.

<LI><KBD>How or when did the author decide to become a writer?</KBD> When the hardware company he was working for went bankrupt in 1818, Irving decided to devote himself entirely to writing literature.

<LI><KBD>What are the most outstanding features of this writer's writing?</KBD> I think that the most outstanding feature of his writing is the humor he puts into the stories. An example of this is <I>A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty</I>. Just by reading the title, you can tell this isn't going to be another straight faced, serious book.

<LI><KBD>Has the author won any awards for his/her writing? if yes, list the awards and the year each was won.</KBD> The only think that I could find that Irving won was the respect of European critics for <I>The Sketch Book</I>.
