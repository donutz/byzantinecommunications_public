<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Letter to Senator Kohl</H1>
Senator Herbert Kohl<BR>
2756 Washington Ave<BR>
Madison, WI  53074<P>
Dear Herbert Kohl:<BR>
I am writing that you recommend the speed limit should be raised from 55 to 65 miles per hour on the highways. I am giving my reasons for this in the following paragraphs.<P>
One reason for raising the speed limit is to allow quicker travel. People who have to get up early in the morning to leave for work would benefit from this. The would be able to get up later and be more awake. This would reduce accidents.<P>
Another reason is most people already travel around 65 mph, and a change in the speed limits would not affect them. This would allow police to devote more time to looking for more serious things than people 10 mph over the current speed limit.<P>
Also a reason is that since the speed limit is higher, it would force automakers into designing cars more efficient at high speeds. This would benefit both people and the environment.<P>
As you can see, there are many advantages to a higher speed limit. It would make for faster travel, give police more time to look for more serious offenders of the law, and allow more efficient travel at high speeds. I hope this letter will help you with your decision.<P>
<DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>Sincerely,</DIV><P>
