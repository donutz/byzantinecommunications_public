Dear Parents<P>
It is once again time for the science students to receive their contract unit.<P>
This year the 7th grade has been selected to participate in the Milwaukee County Zoo's quilting project. Accordingly I have developed this unit around the Zoo's theme of "The World of Birds."<P>
Each Student is to read over and discuss with his/her parent their individual contract: This will assue the projects the student has selected will be completed. Some projects may require parental supervision as well as special supplies. The student may need parental aid on some tasks, however the bulk of the assignment must be completed by the student. The completion of this contract unit will prove to be of great value in developing the student's self confidence and pride.<P>
Thank you for your support and extra help that will make science education fun and interesting.<P>
<DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>Sincerely Miss Kovneski</DIV><P>
