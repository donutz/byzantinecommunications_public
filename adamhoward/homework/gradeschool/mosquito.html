A mosquito is an insect of the family Culicidae, which are widely known because of the blood-sucking habits of the females.<P>
The long, slender body of a mosquito is covered with scales. It also is characterized by its long, delicate looking legs and mouthparts.<P>
Male mosquitos feed on nectar, while most females require blood to mature their eggs.<P>
The Anopheles mosquitos are the only known carriers of the disease malaria. These mosquitos are characterized by in the resting position how they hold their proboscis, head, and body are held in a straight line  but angled to the surface.<P>
"The female deposits her eggs singly on the water surface." The larval Anopheles lie parallel to the surfae, so they do not need to breathe through a tube as most mosquito larvae do. The life cycle of these mosquitos can be from eighteen days to several weeks.<P>
(Quote is from Encyclopaedia Britannica.)<P>
The eggs are laid in the rain forest in heavily vegetated water. These mosquitos are pests to all warm blooded animals there.<P>
