<LI><TT>Describe an instance when the author accomplished something or overcame an obstacle with the help of his friends.</TT><BR>
Benjamin Franklin was working for his brother at the age of 17. His brother owned a newspaper, the <I>New England Courrant</I>. Something in the paper offended the Assembly, and it was ordered that James Franklin (his brother) could no longer print a paper called the <I>New England Courrant</I>. James and his friends decided to print it under the name of Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin took advantage of this, and not believing his brother would hold him to his indentures, decided to leave Boston for New York.<BR>
Benjamin knew if he tried to go by himself, he wouldn't get there. So his friend Collins (I don't know his first name) helped him by getting him passage on a sloop bound for New York. They had a good tail wind and made the trip in three days.<BR>
In New York he met a printer named William Bradford, who, not needing any help, recommeded that he go work for his son, Andrew, in Philadelphia. Ben made part of the 100 mile journey by boat. The ship didn't go any farther, so he decided to walk to Burlington, where he was told he could get a boat to Philadelphia.<BR>
Finally he got to the city, where he knew no one. He met a person who directed him to an inn, and he stayed there until the next day, when he went to see Andrew Bradford's shop. Bradford said he recently hired someone else, but a Keimer in town who recently set up a printing business might need help. Keimer said he had no work to be done, but in a while would need help.<BR>
And this is where I will leave you off.
<LI><TT>Find five adjective that the author used to describe himself. Explain why you do or do not feel each is an accurate description.</TT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>lucky<DD>Yes, I do feel this is accurate because he wrote an anonymous letter to his brother's paper. It wouldn't have been admired as much had he put his name on it, it would have been criticized.
<DT>saucy<DD>Yes, I believe this is accurate because his father most often sided with Ben, this annoyed his brother.
<DT>provoking<DD>Yes, I believe this is accurate because his father sided wit him most often and this annoyed his brother, James.
<DT>ambitious<DD>Yes, I believe this is accurate because he was ambitious to become a good writer, as he had received little schooling.
<DT>desirous<DD>Yes, I believe this is accurate because he would see a friend, named Collins, with whom he would have arrangements, which they both looked forward to and enjoyed.

<LI><TT>The author of this book will be on the News tonight. You have been assigned to interview him. Write down the questions (at least 5) that you will ask. Jot down what you think the answers will be.</TT><HR WIDTH=50%>
"Good evening, and welcome to Channel 2 News. Tonight we've got a special treat for you. Yes, tonight we'll be interviewing the famous Benjamin Franklin. And here he comes!"<P>
(applause)<P>
"Hello and welcome to our show, Mr. Frank--"<P>
"Call me Ben."<P>
"OK, Ben. For our interview we've chosen questions sent in by our viewers. Let's get on, shall we?"<P>
"Why not?"<P>
"OK then. Now, quite a few of our viewers would like to know what you wanted to be when you grew up when you were a kid."<P>
"A nuclear physicist. No, just kidding. I really wanted to be a sailor. Of course, my father was completely against this, so my dream never came true."<P>
"Well, that's very touching, Ben. Now, our next question was sent in by Jerod Luening of St. Francis, WI, and he asks, 'What possessed you to do that experiment with the kite and lightning?'"<P>
"Well, mostly a lot of courage. And, if you would like to know more, you can read my recent best-seller <I>Lightning is Your Friend</I>."<P>
"Which, I might add, we are now selling for $19.95 at B. Dalton Bookstores. Which brings us to our next question, sent in by a John Doe of Mukwanago, WI, who asks, 'What was your first reaction when your brother told you he would be printing the <I>New England Courrant</I> under your name?'"<P>
"When I found that out, I was surprised. But then I found out it was just to keep him from getting in trouble with the government, the English government, and it didn't seem as good as when he first told me."<P>
"Well, our next question, sent in by Matt Beckemeier, is 'What do you think of your portrait being on the 100 dollar bill?'"<P>
"I find it a great honor, who wouldn't? Back when I lived, I would never have thought it possible, but I guess I was wrong."<P>
"And our last question for you, Ben, is 'What do you think of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> Century?'"<P>
"I find it very different from the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century. We had carriages, you have those, what are they again? Ah yes, cars. Imagine, not having to have it pulled by horses. And those airplanes? We had no comparison for them."<P>
Well, that brings us to the end of our show. Remember, next week we're having JFK in, so send us your questions."
