This was a story written by O. Henry. It was 12 pages long. The book I found it in was published in 1953. The main character was Yancye Goree. In the following paragraphs I will explain the story.<P>
Goree lived in a town about 15 miles out of the mountains. He had lost nearly everything he had gambling, and was often drunk.<P>
One day the man who bought his family's house came by with a strange request. He wanted to purchase a feud between the Goree's and the Coltranes for 200 dollars. He wanted to take the place of the Gorees. (His name was Garvey.)<P>
Goree accepted, but lost almost all the money gambling. The next day the last of the Coltranes came by and told Goree he wanted there to be no hostilities between them any more, and he wanted Goree to come over to his house and stay there till he was himself again.<P>
At first he was hesitant but finally agreed. And they left off for Coltrane's house. On the way there they would pass Goree's old home. When they approached it, Goree, not wanting Garvey to kill of this man who had just offered him a new chance aat life, asked him if he could wear Coltrane's jacket, to look dignified. As he suspected, Garvey was waiting and he shot his gun, but it was Goree, not Coltrane that the bullet found.<P>
