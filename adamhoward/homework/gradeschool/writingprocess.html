In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the steps and some techniques of the writing process.<P>
The first step of the writing process is prewriting. This step is where you come up with random ideas. For this you can use brainstorming, where you write everything that comes to mind when you think of the subject, clustering, and freewriting. At this step you need not bother about spelling, paragraphs, etc. Just write words and phrases.<P>
The next step is writing. Now is when you start to organize the words and phrases into sentences and paragraphs. What you will then have is a rough draft or first copy.<P>
The third step is revising. In this step you read over your rough draft. Then you can move sentences, take out overused phrases or cliches, and substitute more specific words for general words. You acn do this by using revising marks.<P>
The fourth and final step is Publishing/Sharing. Now you correct all of your spelling, punctuation, and capitalization errors. Then you write or type your final copy, and share it with your intended audience.<P>
In conclusion, you can see all of the steps and some techniques of the writing process. Now you can confidently go out and write something.<P>
