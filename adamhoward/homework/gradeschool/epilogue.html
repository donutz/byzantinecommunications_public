It has been 10 years since Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler made her deal with James and Claudia Kincaid. For a while, at the beginning, they both visited Mrs. Frankweiler every time they had enough money. But they visited her less in later years; they became more involved in school and other events.<P>
At the age of 19, Claudia married a Matthew Beckemeier, and up to now has had two children, Matthew Jr. and George. But neither Matthew nor her sons are of consequence to this story.<P>
Jamie, on the other hand, at 19 years old, has not married and has no plans of marriage. He has, however, made a great change in his life. He moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a few months ago. He is currently living in an apartment that he shares with Jeff Stasiak. He works at a Taco Bell, owned by Jerod Luening. He is saving up to go to college.<P>
Mrs. Frankweiler died of a heart attack on January 31, 1991. The reading of her will is on February 3. Jamie is coming back to New York on a first-class plane trip, paid by Mrs. Frankweiler.<P>
Among those present at the reading of the will were James Kincaid and Claudia Beckemeier, a representative of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and her family and friends. After the will was read, they were told they would receive their things in about a week.<P>
Claudia, knowing that her brother was saving for college, decided to give Jamie the sketch. So, while he was still in town, Claudia went over to tell him.<P>
Jamie was filled with joy because of this, and promised to pay her back as soon as he could. Claudia knew that he would forget, but it made no difference to her. Just the fact of having known the secret of the sketch was enough for her.<P>
