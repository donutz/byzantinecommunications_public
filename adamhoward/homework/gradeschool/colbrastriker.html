 My monster's name is Colbra Striker. He has a purple head, and a red and 
green body. He has 26 eyes, 13 in front and 13 in back. And he has two colbras 
on the side of his head and he also has two laser beaks on his head. He has 
13 rows of teeth. In the middle of his teeth he has a tooth that poison can 
come out of. He likes to look in school windows and scare the teachers till 
they turn white. His favorite things are pinetrees because he plays catch 
with them. His favorite food is iron, shaped like little circles with ketchup 
and melted rubber. His midnight snack is bricks covered with hot fudge. His 
favorite dessert is ice-cream with green wax on top. <br>
