In the following paragraphs, I will explain how life was better back around the turn of the century, from the late 1800s to the early 1900s.<P>
Back around the turn of the century, the hole in the ozone, water pollution and pesticides in food weren't even a small thought in people's heads.<P>
There also weren't so many murders, and there weren't any Jeff Dahmers. You didn't have to worry about getting killed for what you wore when walking downtown. You didn't have any reason to worry when walking downtown for any reason, except maybe that you might get held up talking to a friend, and might be delayed for a time.<P>
There are also many other reasons that made life simpler and better at the time the video showed.<P>
As you can see, life <U>was</U> better back then for many reasons.<P>
