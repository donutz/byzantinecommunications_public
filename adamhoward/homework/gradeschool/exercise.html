For our exercise program, you start out by warming up with a few stretches, such as back stretch, toe touch, butterfly, and arm circles.<P>
After your stretching, you do 10 sit-ups, then rest 30 seconds, then 10 more. After that, take your pulse rate and rest for 45 seconds.<P>
After that you do some stairclimbing for 3 minutes. The best place to do this is by going up a down escalator. After that take your pulse (take your pulse after every exercise).<P>
Next (after resting 45 seconds) do 30 jumping jacks, rest for 15 seconds, then do 15 more. Rest one minute.<P>
Do 10 push-ups next, rest for 35 seconds, then do 12 more. Rest for 1 minute.<P>
Hop on your bike or exercise bike next, you're going to bicycle for 1 mile. After that, rest for 2 minutes.<P>
Then you bench press a quarter of your weight, for 3 times. Rest 3 minutes.<P>
For the next exercise you do as many pull-ups as you can. Then you rest for 45 seconds.<P>
After that you jog in place for 1 minute and rest 30 seconds.<P>
Next you hand on the pull-up bar with your chin above it for as long as you can. Then you rest for 30 seconds.<P>
After that you lift dumbbells of 8-10 lbs 5 times per arm, rest for 20 seconds, then repeat.<P>
After that, see other sheet.<P><HR>
