One early morning when I was walking across the beach to get a boat to go
fishing, I saw something walking across the water. I saw that it had green
clothes. Was it a leprechaun? I got a boat and slowly went to see. Sure enough,
it was a leprechaun. I got my boat right behind him and he disappeared. Then
I turned around and there it was right in my boat! I didn't grab him because
he might disappear again. <br>
<br>
So I just rowed back to shore. I was just about to go when he called my name.
He said he would grant me a wish because I did not grab him. So I thought
of a wish. I wished I was a great scientist. All of the sudden when I got
home my room turned into a lab.<br>
