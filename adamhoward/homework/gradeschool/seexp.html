<STRONG>Matt:</STRONG> Hi, my name is James L Scott. I'm going on a

      business trip to Orlando, Florida. <P>

<STRONG>Nik:</STRONG> And I'm Chief Fungus by the River Ti-pan III.

     I'm going to an archery contest in Tyrone, Georgia.<P>

<STRONG>Adam:</STRONG> This is your captain speaking. Please fasten

      your seatbelts, as we will be encountering some

      minor turbulence. Thank-you.<P>

<STRONG>Nik:</STRONG> I don't need to buckle up. I know I'm in good

     hands with SOUTHEAST EXPRESS.<P>

<STRONG>Mr.Foley:</STRONG> Trademark, Registered, Copyrighted.<P>

<STRONG>Matt:</STRONG> Are you sure, Chief Fungi? The captain said 


      to buckle up.<P>

<STRONG>Nik:</STRONG> I am Chief Fungus by the River Ti-pan III.

     I will do what I want. And you will do what I

     want too.<P>

   (Begin to shake camera.)<P>

   (Matt and Nik get thrown around.)<P>


   (Stop shaking camera!) <P>

   (Matt and Nik climb back toward their seats.)<P>

<STRONG>Adam:</STRONG> This is your captain speaking. That turbulence was a little worse than I expected. Aren't you glad you were wearing your seatbelts? The flight attendants will begin passing out (beverages) shortly. Oh, wait, I think I see a little more turbulence up ahead!<P>

   (Stop camera!)<P>

   (Hold up cloud scene with plane in front of camera.)<P>

   (Start camera.)<P>
