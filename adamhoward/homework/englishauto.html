<h1>English: Autobiography: Me</h1>
On October 24, 1977, (one week before Halloween) God brought a small child to life at Trinity Hospital in Cudahy, WI. That child was me.<P>
For the first year and a half I lived at some house on Martin Avenue in Cudahy, WI. After that I moved to 3708A East Van Norman Avenue, also in Cudahy. W lived upstairs from Tim and Jean something-or-another (I don't know their last name) and the children, Jamie and Justin.<P>
I lived at that house until 3rd grade, at which time we moved to 3713 S. Bombay Ave. in St. Francis, Wisconsin. We lived there until a few years ago (I think I was in 6th grade), when we had to move due to plans by the DOT to put a highway through our backyard. One or two years ago that house was torn down. We currently live at 3764 E. Armour Ave, Cudahy, Wisconsin.<P>
